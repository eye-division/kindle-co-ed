      <h2><strong>Expertise</strong></h2>
      <p class="callout center-this-text"><strong style="background-color: white; font-size: 1.25em;">I have worked directly with children, young people and families&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">in</span><em style="font-size: 1.25em;"> </em><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">public sector project development and through strategic partnerships at agency level for over 25 years.

      <p><strong></strong><strong>A little more about Jo ....</strong></p>
      <p>My commitment to developing the skills, talents &amp; lifechances of Children &amp; Young People is longstanding, along with my belief in advocacy as an agent of change.</p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Following a decade or so working on large scale and infrastructure projects for young people routed through Cultural Services and the Creative Industries, I have focused my attention in more recent years on work which develops provision and infrastructure around</span><b style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;</b><em style="font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Families (<font color="#7271a0">including</font>&nbsp;Learning and those who are <font color="#7271a0">vulnerable</font>)</strong></em><b style="font-size: 1.25em;">,&nbsp;</b><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Mental Health and&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;">SEND</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">. Creativity and the Arts remain close to my heart.</span><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong>I am a fan of the role of advocacy as as force for positive good, and of&nbsp;<strong>Coaching</strong>. Alongside organisational <strong>Consultancy</strong> and P<strong>roject Management</strong>, these form the planks of my current professional offer.</p>
      <p>I hold a Certificate from&nbsp;<em><strong>EMCC</strong></em> in <strong><em>S</em></strong><em><strong>upervision of <font color="#7271a0">Consultants</font>, Coaches and Mentors</strong><b> </b></em>in the workplace.</p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <div>At practice-level, I originally trained as a Music Practitioner graduating University of Surrey in Orchestral Conducting. It sounds an odd connection to what I do now, granted, but actually those disciplines have much in common - discipline, team work, coaching skills and creating a 'bigger picture' greater than the sum of the parts. Orchestras are also communities and where compassion, respect and diversity are the lifeblood. <strong>The move from practitioner to strategist in the Public Sector</strong>&nbsp;began for me back in the 1990s when I moved to a Local Authority on Merseyside to work a Family Learning team, promoting the lifechances of vulnerable families. In one guise or another, I have not left since.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>Despite its difficult challenges, the Public Sector - and its network of partners in the <strong>Charitable</strong>, <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Voluntary</strong> sectors- remains a vibrant place to work with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong>. The way we do business and interact has radically altered but the dynamics of <strong>change</strong>, <strong>influencing</strong>,<strong> collaboration</strong>&nbsp;and of&nbsp;<strong>shared</strong>&nbsp;<strong>purpose</strong>&nbsp;are still built on the quality of <strong>Relationships.&nbsp;</strong>We have an opportunity every day to make a direct &amp; positive impact on the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People......<strong></strong></div>
