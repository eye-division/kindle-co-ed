        <p>"we are living in times of Revolutionary change....a global revolution....for which there are no precedents...our children are confronting challenges that are unique in human history"</p>
        <h6>(Sir Ken Robinson, Out of Our Minds, 3rd Edition, 2017)</h6>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The job of<strong> <em style="font-weight: bold;">looking</em> </strong>ahead<strong>, <em style="font-weight: bold;">understanding</em> </strong>the external landscape,<strong>&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">preparing </em></strong>for change,&nbsp;<strong><em style="font-weight: bold;">moving</em> </strong>forward together,<strong> </strong>has never been more challenging for&nbsp;<em><strong>Public Sector </strong></em>&amp;<em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>Social Purpose </strong></em>partners....</p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of <em><strong>societal change</strong> </em>is eye-watering and, in a working environment influenced by <strong><em>public policy</em></strong>, change can be <strong><em>overwhelming</em></strong>.</p>
      <p>It can also be&nbsp;<em><strong>inspiring</strong></em> and full of <em><strong>opportunity</strong></em>.</p>
      <p><strong>KindleCo</strong>&nbsp;exists to help <em><strong>Public Sector &amp; Social Purpose</strong></em> organisations occupied with sector-level change, and their related professionals, meet these challenges:<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Jo Broad </strong>specialises<strong> </strong>in <strong>enabling </strong>organisations, and individual professionals, to find their own<strong> creative</strong>,<strong> meaningful &amp; pragmatic </strong>ways to turn <strong>external change </strong>into a driver for their own <strong>strategic development.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I am values - led &amp; outcomes-driven. My professional watchwords are to work in the spirit of &nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>Collaboration </strong>with<strong>&nbsp;Compassion</strong>, <strong>Courage&nbsp; </strong>&amp;&nbsp;<strong> Creativity</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong></strong><strong><em>I'd like to invite you on a journey ....</em></strong>to build even greater <em><strong>meaning</strong></em>, <em><strong>resilience</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>impact</strong></em> into your work, to strengthen outcomes for your <em><strong>end-beneficiaries</strong></em> and with it, your contribution to <strong><em>systems-change...</em></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>I believe....</strong></p>
      <p>whether it is nurturing stakeholder buy-in (<strong>we <em>all </em>have stakeholders</strong>), leveraging collaboration (<strong><em>we all engage with organisations</em></strong>), galvanising political will (we all <em>have</em> a voice) or unlocking investment (<strong>influence cannot always be <em>counted</em><em> </em>in money</strong>), we <em><strong>all have the opportunity </strong></em>to make a <em><strong>positive impact on the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong></em>.</p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years of working directly with Children &amp; Young People and with the agencies who champion them,</strong> I <strong>facilitate</strong>, <strong>support</strong>&nbsp;&amp; <strong>enable</strong>&nbsp;those working in a Government - influenced business environment to develop themselves strategically. Often, although not exclusively, through enabling collaboration to flourish between organisations, we can together add greater <em><strong>depth</strong></em> and <em><strong>impact</strong></em> to your professional portfolio, nurturing your own <em><strong>growth </strong></em>&amp; <em><strong>sustainability</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>I aim to <strong>build capabilities in others, </strong>through<strong>:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Prioritising key Social Policy areas</strong><strong><strong>,</strong> I share a passion for the stakeholder dynamics which foster:</strong>
      </p>
      <p><em>Social Inclusion, Lifelong Learning (Education &amp; Skills), Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing, Creativity, the Arts</em></p>
      <h2>Expertise<strong></strong></h2>
      <h2><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level.</h2>
      <p><strong>I understand the challenges and the joys of </strong>inter-agency working, of stringent funding criteria and of complex stakeholder dynamics.</p>
      <p><strong>If you enjoy a little bit of professional history, read on.....otherwise you can jump straight to my 2018 Services Flyer <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/KindleCo_A5_Flyer_DIGITAL (003).pdf">here</a></strong></p>

      <p><strong>I trained as a Musician</strong>, and have spent many years directly coaching <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adult learners for good measure)&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for public performance.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p>
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>They say the best learning experiences are 'modelled' and I am to this day grateful and appreciative of the commitment <strong>Essex County Council</strong> showed during the 1980s (and still do today, despite funding constraints) to the development of its Young People, particularly outside of School. I count my blessing every day to have been a beneficiary of the vibrant Essex <strong>County Music Service</strong> who funded me on a Scholarship to the Junior Guildhall, J_RAM and beyond, for the best part of 6 years.</p>
      <p>Their illustrious <strong>Essex Youth Orchestra&nbsp;</strong>movement, which celebrated its 60th Birthday in 2017, shaped me for life and probably a few of their staff with it.... (apologies in retrospect to any Youth Service staff, who are still with us, and may still remember a certain trip to Poland when I was a teenager .....).</p>
      <p>You learn alot about hard work, self- discipline, collaboration, team work and the nature of Leadership in Orchestras.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I furthered my passion for with a BMus. Hons in Conducting<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(yes the type with the white stick, only I never used one of those), which I appreciate, can seem an odd qualification for '<em><strong>strategy &amp;</strong></em> <em><strong>organisational development</strong></em>'. Hang on in there....</p>
      <p>Those <strong>disciplines are very closely aligned</strong>. They pivot on planning ahead, knowing the background - middleground -foreground, understanding your available resources,&nbsp;<strong>getting the best out of people</strong>, enabling&nbsp;<strong>collaboration&nbsp;</strong>and most important, creating an experience for other people's benefit, which is<b>&nbsp;</b><strong>bigger than the sum of its individual parts</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong></strong>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in 1998</strong> when I took on the artistic programming and <strong>business development</strong> of a <strong>community-led venture</strong> in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education. We also let in a few Film Crews so I got to hob nob with Joseph Fiennes, Kate Blanchett (once!) and Eric Cantona..... well, it was his post-football phase.</p>
      <p>Bitten by the multi-agency working bug, and a commitment to using the Arts for social change, this prompted a move to <strong>a Local Authority </strong>on Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer.</p>
      <p>Spurred on by that organisation's incredible (and still enduring) commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion, Regeneration &amp; Mobility, I established the towns first ever cross-agency <strong>Cultural Partnership</strong> and with it, a first <strong>Creative Industries business incubation </strong>programme for <strong>Young People. </strong>There followed a new <strong>Youth Theatre,</strong> <strong>Disability Arts </strong>Programme and successful bids to the Government's&nbsp;<strong>Standards </strong><strong>Fund</strong>, <strong>Arts Council </strong>(in its previous incarnation)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and a first dive into ERDF, all helping to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>light the way with resources.</p>
      <p>I delivered a stint at <strong>Arts Council England</strong>&nbsp;(as one of their Regional Officers for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills) in the&nbsp; in the early 2000s. Tasked with leading the construction of their new three-year regional <em><strong>Learning &amp; Skills strategy </strong></em>under a new CEO, and the regional roll out of our national programmes, this placed me alongside sizeable clusters of local authorities, public agencies, schools, private sector organisations, employers and artistic stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The thrill of multi-agency working was cemented during those years, along with a love of Situational Leadership, as an agent for change.</p>
      <p>I was fortunate enough to have a particularly driven CEO, with high expectations of her staff, a robust commitment to in-house CPD and ambitions for the Region on behalf of her stakeholders.</p>
      <p>She enabled me to forge a first corporate cross-sector partnership between <strong>ACE</strong>, <strong>BAA</strong> and the then- <strong>LSC, </strong>producing a&nbsp;<em><strong>Workforce development</strong></em> programme with Local Authorities and FE Providers, using the Arts as a delivery mechanism with <strong>NEETs</strong>. I also has some amazing colleagues who continue to bring moments of joy into my working life today, on the all too rare moments we get to spend time together.</p>
      <p>In life, I believe you must&nbsp;<strong>grow where you are planted</strong>. I was planted in <strong>Oxfordshire </strong>through family circumstance in 2004 and <strong>KindleCo was born</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I have worked hard to keep developing my <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>empathy </strong>and <strong>skill set</strong> to continue to support our <strong>Public Sector,</strong> <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Charity colleagues</strong> -&nbsp; those who strive ever day to enhance the <strong>lifechances of our Children &amp; Young People</strong>. My focus in the last 5 years has been increasingly on Children made <em><strong>vulnerable</strong></em> through circumstance.</p>
      <p>You can read more about my current &amp; previous <em><strong>commissions through KindleCo</strong></em>&nbsp;in my <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/casestudies/kindleco-supports-innovative-leadership-at-national-childrens-charity/"><strong>Case Studies</strong></a> section. I also do a spot of Social Responsibility work each year, as and when resources allow. I have contributed through <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="https://mindedforfamilies.org.uk/">Young Minds</a> in the past, and am currently supporting some of the&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="https://www.ncb.org.uk/">NCB</a>'s efforts.</p>
      <p>Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>'Co Production'</strong> is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      <p>It does go rather nicely with '<strong><em>Collaboration</em>'</strong>, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle. <strong><em>'Courage'</em></strong>,<strong><em> </em></strong>like <strong><em>'Creativity',</em></strong> needs to be nurtured.<em><b>&nbsp;</b></em>When your life involves alot of Co Production, you have to marshal it.</p>

      <p>I now work mostly as a single Consultant or Project Lead.</p>
      <p>Through <strong>KindleCo</strong>, small teams of associates can be arranged where needed.</p>
