        <p><strong>A little more about Jo ....</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>My commitment to developing the skills and lifechances of Children &amp; Young People is longstanding</strong></em>, <em><strong>along with my belief in advocacy and systems-thinking as agents of change</strong></em></p>
        <p>After a period working through the Cultural Services &amp; Creative Industries on multi-agency projects at local, sub-regional and regional agency levels, I have expanded my practice skills in order to be able to support organisations delivering within complex stakeholder environments on the agendas for <strong>Wellbeing, Learning</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Vulnerable</strong> children.</p>
        <p>I am a qualified <em><strong>Mental Health First-Aider </strong></em>(adult) with a passion for Workforce Development</p>
        <p>A committed contributor to <strong>Co Production</strong>, I have worked in local government in&nbsp;<strong>Family Learning</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>serving some of the most deprived and vulnerable families of the UK.&nbsp; I have worked with a multitude LAs both singly and as part of regional partnerships spanning locations <strong>Greater Manchester</strong>, <strong>Merseyside</strong>, <strong>London</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>East England</strong></p>
        <p>I have led strategic partnerships on behalf of Local Authorities and held responsibility for a regional portfolio with Arts Council England. I have brokered cross-sector and mixed-disciplinary partnerships between public sector, community-led organisations and private sector organisations with <em><strong>corporate social responsibility </strong></em>programmes influencing decision-makers to create provision and resources to benefit Children &amp; Young People through collaboration</p>
        <p>I understand the need for sustainability to remain centre-stage in Organisational Development and in sector-level change.</p>
        <p>I am able to share with clients my experience of winning bids for KindleCo contracts through competitive tendering, of leading <em><strong>successful funding </strong></em>applications to regional programmes on behalf of <em><strong>public agency partnerships,</strong></em> of building successful submissions to <em><strong>Government and European funding </strong></em>pots, such as the Standards Fund, Lottery and delegated ERDF.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although I do not undertake bid-writing as a stand-alone task, clients can be sure I bring to the table a skills-set that allows me to provide well-informed support to clients who must focus <strong>future-proofing</strong>. I will help you ensure your strategic plans take care of the&nbsp;<strong>resources</strong>, <strong>language </strong>and <strong>partnerships</strong> which can promote your <strong>sustainability</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I now also <strong>Coach professionals</strong> working in and alongside the Public Sector in Education and other social purpose settings, to enable successful <strong>workplace transitions</strong> including return to work for <strong>#carers</strong>.</p>

        <h3 class="center-this-text"><strong></strong>Here are thoughts about <em>Working Together</em></h3>
        <p><strong>What will we have in common?</strong></p>
        <p>A shared passion, need and / or commitment to delivering against a <em><strong>canvass of public policy</strong></em>, in a <em><strong>mixed economy</strong></em> of providers, under <strong><em>diverse political</em>&nbsp;</strong>leadership, for <em><strong>end-beneficiaries</strong></em> of <em><strong>Children, Young People &amp; Families</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>What work could we do together ? &nbsp;</strong><strong>In a nutshell....<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>deepen an understanding of your external environment, navigate and shape it through policy-response &amp; strategy development</li>
          <li>build meaningful alliances around your purpose through stakeholder engagement and strategic partnerships&nbsp;</li>
          <li>deploy external change as a driver for your own project or organisational development</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What would the outcomes be?</strong></p>
        <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my consultancy is bespoke. But alongside&nbsp; specific task objectives, I strive to build:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Knowledge,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Confidence, Capacity &amp; Capability</strong></li>
          <li><strong></strong>A rounded <strong>360 view of resource development: </strong>this is a "must" in today's fiscal climate,&nbsp; so expect our discussions to include developing objectives around strategic <strong>partnerships</strong>, sector&nbsp;<strong>positioning</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong>, as well as <strong>funding</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div><strong></strong>I originally trained as a Music Practitioner. &nbsp;It sounds an odd connection to what I do now but actually those disciplines have much in common - team work, coaching for performance, knowing the internal and external environment: making the <em><strong>'bigger picture' </strong></em>more than the sum of its individual parts. Orchestras are communities where hard work, skill, compassion, respect and diversity are the lifeblood. <strong>Collaboration matters</strong>.</div>
