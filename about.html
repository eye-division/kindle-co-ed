      <p><strong>as watchwords</strong></p>
      <p>I'd like to invite you on a journey to build resilience and impact into your work, but also enable it make a contribution to systems-change whether that be close to home or further afield: by leveraging cross-sector engagement, winning stakeholder buy-in, enabling inter-agency collaboration, galvanising political will and unlocking investment, we all have the opportunity to make an impact for Children &amp; Young People.</p>
      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level</p>
      <p><b>I understand the challenges and the joys of inter-agency working, of cross-sector partnerships, stringent funding criteria and of complex stakeholder dynamics. I am am also a great&nbsp;</b>
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>believer</b></font><b>&nbsp;in </b><strong>#realtionships first</strong><b></b></p>
      <p>I trained initially as a Musician, spending many years coaching children, young people &amp; adults in schools, extended service settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, working towards public performances</font>. I furthered my own professional development with a BMus. Hons in Conducting, with a dab of Concert Management, Orchestration and Early Childhood Musical Literacy thrown in for good measure!</p>
      <p>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the Public Sector in 1998 when I took on the artistic programming and business development of a community-led venture in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before I was bitten by the Strategy bug, and soon became a fan of multi-agency working, prompting a move to St Helens Council in Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer. Boyed on by their incredible commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion &amp; Economic Regeneration, I established the towns first ever cross-agency Cultural Partnership and with it, a first Creative Industries business incubation programme for Young People. It was also a period when we managed to persuade the powers that be to fund a new Youth Theatre, Disability Arts Programme and contribute to the Day in the Dome event marking the Millennium - taking 50 of the regions brightest young talents to London to perform with successful bids to the Standards Fund, Arts Council and European ERDF bids via Merseyside ACME, lighting the way.</p>
      <p>Combining experience of developing strategy in multi-agency contexts, spring-boarding new projects in the Public Sector and life as a former Orchestra Coach, I delivered a stint at Arts Council England as their Regional Officer for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills in the early 2000s. This allowed me to stretch my situational Leadership legs, leading the construction with stakeholders, of ACE East's new three-year Learning &amp; Skills strategy, alongside the regional roll out of major national programmes Spaces for Sport &amp; the Arts and Creative Partnerships. It is a time I look back on with great joy as a colleague, and great pride as a professional.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In life, I believe you can grow where you are planted. I was planted in Oxfordshire through family circumstance in 2004 and KindleCo was born. Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!</p>
      <p>I have been busy learning all about parts of the Public Sector I would never have anticipated pre-motherhood...... !</p>
      <p>Co Production is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      <p>It goes rather nicely with the spirit of Collaboration, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle!</p>
      <p>I bring a unique blend of skills to what I do. I aim to help organisations to collaborate, where this is relevant &amp; meaningful and can add value to their offer. I am experienced and skilled in the nurture of new projects and I support transitions equally well. I &nbsp;am a great believer in the value too, of Stakeholder relations to organisations which must operate in Government-influenced working environment.</p>
      <p>Enabling others to experience the value of creating sound, well-informed Strategy as part of wider Organisational Development, is a great personal motivator for me.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I have been known to get quite high on&nbsp; helping others to unlock the opportunities in external change!</p>
