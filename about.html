<div class="editable">
	<p>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years of working with, in, and through the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level.
I understand the challenges and the joys of inter-agency working, cross-sector partnerships and mixed-disciplinary projects. </p>

<p>I'd like to invite you on a journey to build resilience and impact into your work, but also enable it make a contribution to systems-change whether that be close to home or further afield: by leveraging cross-sector engagement, winning stakeholder buy-in, enabling inter-agency collaboration, galvanising political will and unlocking investment, we all have the opportunity to make an impact for Children &amp; Young People.</p>
