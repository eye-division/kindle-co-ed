        <p><strong>Here are some things which will bind us in shared purpose, should we work together:</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />recognising the special value of <strong>Collaboration</strong> in social and educational purpose work</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />believing in <strong>equality </strong><strong>of opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />a love of<strong> </strong> <strong>systems </strong><strong>- thinking</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />believing <strong>compassion -&nbsp;</strong><strong>led&nbsp;</strong>design of services is possible</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />witness to the transformative power of <strong>creativity </strong></p>
        <p>If you are open and curious about such things, or already have your own way of showing commitment to them, we will likely work extremely well together.</p>
        <p class="center-this-text">Through KindleCo, I strive to share experience built over more than 25 years of work with young people, families and, the organisations that support them. I have led the design &amp; development of <strong>strategic programmes</strong> and <strong>cross-boundary projects</strong> in the public sector, supported a range of private clients from <strong>education charities</strong> to <strong>public agencies</strong>, and enabled individual <strong>projects</strong> &amp; <strong>professionals</strong> to reach their goals<b style="color: rgb(114, 113, 160); font-size: 1.5625em;">&nbsp;</b></p>

        </h3>
        <p class="center-this-text"><em><strong>A little more about Jo .... m</strong><strong style="font-style: italic;">y commitment to developing the lifechances of </strong></em><em><strong style="font-style: italic;">Children &amp; Young People is longstanding</strong></em></p>
        <p>After a period working with <em><strong>Arts, Cultural Services &amp; Creative Industries</strong></em> on Government funded projects for Children &amp; Young People at locality and regional - agency level, I expanded my professional practice skills to include specific support for organisations with end-beneficiaries of <em><strong>Vulnerable Families </strong></em>. I now engage in a wider menu of activities with sector champions for&nbsp;<em><strong>Wellbeing, Learning, Creativity and Education.</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a qualified Adult&nbsp;<em><strong>Mental Health First-Aider.</strong></em></p>
        <p>As a committed advocate for&nbsp;<em><strong>Co Production</strong></em>, I have worked in local government in&nbsp;<em><strong>Family Learning</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>serving some of the most deprived and vulnerable families of the UK.&nbsp; I have worked with a critical mass of diverse Local Authorities in locations spanning&nbsp;<em><strong>Merseyside</strong>, <strong>Greater Manchester</strong>, <strong>London</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>East England</em>&nbsp;</strong>either singly, or as consortia in strategic roles, driving a number of regional partnerships. I have led strategic intervention work with public agencies including a regional portfolio with Arts Council England, leading the regional roll-out of national programmes with Schools. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Brokering cross-boundary partnerships </strong>between organisations in the past, has given me a sound grasp of the dynamics of mixed-disciplinary work.</p>
        <div>
          <div><strong>I originally trained as a Music Practitioner training children &amp; young people (and a few adults for good measure) in group music practice. </strong>Having been raised, creatively-speaking, in the English conservatoire system as a child , studying at both the Guildhall and Royal Academy of Music junior departments, I later took up conducting completing my Honours Degree in performance at the University of Surrey. Children &amp; Young People, what and how they learn and the bigger societal picture, have never been very far from my mind throughout. Not many people did a research project on 'Systematic methods of String Teaching and Early Childhood Education' when I was at University! &nbsp;It all&nbsp; sounds an odd connection to what I do now, but actually, the process of bringing diverse stakeholders&nbsp; together around common purpose and group music practice, are disciplines with much to learn from each other: <em><strong>team work, coaching, knowing your internal and external landscapes, embracing harmony and dissonance, delivering for a shared mission....</strong></em> Orchestras are essentially one big learning community: hard work, a focus on skills-building, compassion, mutual respect and diversity are the lifeblood - collaboration is 'do or die', artistically and socially.</div>
          <div class="center-this-text">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="center-this-text"><em><strong>The big picture really is, more than the sum, of the individual parts.</strong></em></div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
        </div>
        <div class="center-this-text">&nbsp;</div>
        <h3 class="center-this-text">IMPACT</h3>
        <p>Successfully influencing decision-makers to create provision and resources to benefit Children &amp; Young People, through collaboration with others, is part of my track record and I firmly believe 'Collaboration' is a value and a behaviour we choose to adopt, not just a process exclusively reserved for those operating at scale.</p>
        <p>I also understand the need for <strong>sustainability to remain centre-stage</strong> in Organisational Development and in sector-level change.</p>
        <p>I am able to share with clients my experience of winning bids for KindleCo contracts through competitive tendering, of leading <em><strong>successful funding </strong></em>applications to regional programmes on behalf of <em><strong>public agency partnerships,</strong></em> of building successful submissions to <em><strong>Government and European funding </strong></em>pots, such as the Standards Fund, Lottery and delegated ERDF.</p>
        <p>Although I do not undertake bid-writing as a stand-alone task, you can be sure I bring to the table experience which enables me to provide well-informed support to clients, in an age where <strong>future-proofing is key</strong>. I will help you ensure your strategic plans take care of the&nbsp;<strong>resources</strong>, <strong>language </strong>and strategic&nbsp;<strong>partnerships</strong> which can promote your <strong>sustainability.</strong></p>
        <p>I now also <strong>Coach professionals</strong> working in and alongside the Public Sector in Education and other social purpose settings, to enable successful <strong>workplace transitions.</strong> I love bringing a combination of lived and professional experience, to supporting&nbsp;<strong>#carers returning to work.</strong></p>
        <p>I undertake a small amount of Social Responsibility activity each year, despite being a micro-enterprise myself, and currently living my values through active participation as a member of the <em><strong>National Children's Bureau's&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="/news/"><strong>Family Research Advisory Group</strong></a></p>
