      <p><strong>For the Public Sector </strong>&amp; its partners in&nbsp;<strong>Social Purpose</strong>, the job of<strong> <em style="font-weight: bold;">looking</em> </strong>ahead<strong>, <em>understanding&nbsp;</em></strong>the external landscape,<strong>&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">responding&nbsp;</em></strong>to change and&nbsp;<strong><em style="font-weight: bold;">moving</em> </strong>ahead,<strong> </strong>has never been more challenging</p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of current&nbsp;<strong>societal change&nbsp;</strong>is eye-watering. In business environments influenced by <strong>public policy</strong>, it can be&nbsp;<strong>overwhelming</strong>.</p>
      <p>But it can also be&nbsp;<em><strong>inspiring</strong></em> and full of <em><strong>opportunity</strong></em>.</p>
      <p><strong><strong>KindleCo</strong>&nbsp;exists to help <strong>Public Sector &amp; Social Purpose</strong> organisations meet these challenges </strong>to build perspective, create strategy, grow capability, to galvanise action.</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>Jo&nbsp;</strong><strong>specialises in </strong><strong>enabling </strong><strong>organisations&nbsp;</strong>to find ways to turn external change into a driver for their own strategic development, working with four enduring principles: -</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><strong></strong>Collaboration,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Compassion</strong>, <strong>Courage &amp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Creativity</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><strong><em>I'd like to invite you on a journey ....</em></strong></strong>to nurture the meaning, resilience &amp; impact in your work which will strengthen the future outcomes for your beneficiaries and your contribution to <strong>systems-change</strong>&nbsp;...<strong></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I believe we all have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People whether it is through <strong>cultivating</strong> stakeholders,&nbsp;<strong>brokering</strong> collaboration,&nbsp;<strong>galvanising</strong> political will or and <strong>unlocking</strong> investment (influence is not always counted in money).</p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years</strong>,&nbsp;<strong></strong>I facilitate, support &amp; enable those working in a Government - influenced business environment, to develop themselves strategically.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>I aim to </strong><strong><strong>build self-efficacy &amp; capability</strong>&nbsp;</strong>at organisational, team &amp; individual level through<strong>:</strong></p>

      <p><strong> I share a passion for the stakeholder dynamics in<strong>&nbsp;key Policy areas -</strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p><em>Social Inclusion, Lifelong Learning (Education &amp; Skills), Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing, Creativity &amp; the Arts</em></p>
      <h2>Expertise<strong></strong></h2>
      <h2><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in, with and through the Public Sector</h2>
      <p><strong>I understand the challenges and the joys of the national landscape and of </strong>inter-agency working,&nbsp; funding criteria and complex stakeholder dynamics at&nbsp;<strong>local, regional &amp; sector levels.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>If you enjoy a little bit of professional history, read on.....otherwise you can jump straight to my 2018 Services Flyer <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/KindleCo_A5_Flyer_DIGITAL (003).pdf">here</a></strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong><b></b><strong>I originally trained as a Musician</strong>, and have spent many years directly coaching <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adult learners )&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and privately, building their capacity &amp; capability for public performance.&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>
      </p>
      <p>I furthered my passion for team work with a BMus. Hons in Conducting which I appreciate, can seem an odd qualification for '<em><strong>strategy &amp;</strong></em> <em><strong>organisational development</strong></em>'.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>But those disciplines are very closely aligned - getting the best out of people and creating something which is bigger than the sum of its individual parts.<strong></strong>&nbsp;I entered the realms of working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in a strategic capacity in 1998 </strong>and in one way or another, have not left since. I think its a great place with committed professionals, along with those in the Voluntary, Charity and Social Enterprise sectors who partner them. If you would like a gander through an extended Biog, you can download one <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/Biog_JoBroad_July18.pdf">here.</a></p>
      <p>I now work mostly through <strong>KindleCo&nbsp;</strong>as a single Consultant or Project Lead but small teams of associates can be arranged where needed.</p>
      <p><strong>What I don't do:</strong> I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you to align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership, project or personal strategy.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>I welcome informal and exploratory chats. You can also Tweet me!</strong></p>
