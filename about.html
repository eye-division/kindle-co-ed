      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Through <em>KindleCo</em></strong>, I share an enduring&nbsp;<strong>commitment to equality of opportunity </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;a passion for sector dynamics</strong> in the key Public Policy areas of&nbsp;<strong>Social <em>Inclusion</em></strong>, Lifelong <em><strong>Learning</strong></em> (Education &amp; Skills), <strong><em>Mental</em> </strong>Health, the Arts and&nbsp;<strong><em>Creativity</em></strong>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
      <p><strong>I strive to enable </strong>the organisations &amp; individuals who keep the <strong>Children &amp; Families sector</strong> afloat, to turn external change into a driver for their own strategic development.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Working with</strong>&nbsp;my four enduring principles of&nbsp;<em><strong>Collaboration</strong></em>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Compassion</strong></em>, <em><strong>Courage</strong></em> &amp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Creativity</strong></em>,<em><strong></strong></em><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>KindleCo exists to enable our sector champions to take forward their ambitions:</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;to build <em><strong>perspective</strong></em>, create pragmatic&nbsp;<em><strong>strategies,</strong></em> grow <em><strong>capability </strong></em>and galvanise <em><strong>action</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>For the Public Sector &amp; its Social Purpose partners</strong>, the job of <em>looking</em> ahead, <em>understanding</em>&nbsp;the external landscape,&nbsp;<em>responding</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>moving </em>forward, has never been more challenging<strong></strong></p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of <strong>current</strong>&nbsp;<strong>societal change is eye-watering</strong>. In stakeholder-rich environments influenced by <strong>public policy</strong>, it <strong>can feel</strong>&nbsp;<strong>overwhelming, and&nbsp;</strong><strong>inspiring</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>It is also full of opportunity.</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years</strong>, I facilitate, support &amp; enable those working in a Government - influenced business environment, to develop themselves strategically, find opportunity in change and in working with others.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong>At organisation, team, stakeholder &amp; individual professional levels,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong><strong><strong> </strong>strive to build self-efficacy &amp; capability in others through support for:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Policy - understanding, response, insight &amp; <strong>shaping&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Strategy - creation, interpretation &amp; <strong>execution</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Brokerage - planning, positioning, <strong>enacting</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Systems - thinking, planning &amp; <strong>expression</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Evaluation - reflecting, knowing, <strong>changing</strong></em></p>

        <p><strong><strong><em>I'd like to invite you on a journey ....</em></strong></strong>to nurture the meaning, resilience &amp; impact in your work which will strengthen outcomes for your beneficiaries and <em><strong>your contribution to positive&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>s</strong>ystems-change</strong>&nbsp;.</em>..<strong></strong></p>

      <h3><strong>Expertise</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <h4><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the more than 25 years </strong>of working in, with &amp; through the Public Sector</h4>
      <p><strong>If you enjoy a little bit of professional history</strong>,<strong> </strong>you can mine&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/Biog_JoBroad_July18f.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;<strong>....</strong>or you can jump straight to my <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/KindleCo_A5_Flyer_DIGITAL (003).pdf">2018 Services Flyer&nbsp;</a></p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>I originally trained as a Musician </strong>and grew up in the English state school &amp; Music Conservatoire systems.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I found these to be a 'place for all', socially -speaking.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><b></b>
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>Professionally</b></font><b>,&nbsp;</b><strong>I spent many years directly coaching</strong> <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adults)&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for public performance.&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>
      </p>
      <p>I furthered my passion for team work with a degree in Conducting (yes the baton-waving type, only I never used one of those...) and I do recognise, this can seem an odd qualification for a later career in Public Sector projects and organisational development....</p>
      <p><i></i><strong>But those disciplines are very closely aligned - success depends on getting the best out of people, cultivating shared endeavour,</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;</span>building&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25em;"></span>structure behind the scenes and most of all, creating something collaboratively far greater, than the sum of the individual parts.....</p>
      <p><strong>Working alongside the Public Sector in a strategic capacity</strong>, <strong>and as part of a</strong> <strong>Partnership effort</strong>, began for me in earnest in 1998 and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in one guise or another, I have not left since. Despite its difficult challenges - including all the clammer about funding levels - the Public Sector remains a vibrant place to work, with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong>.</p>
      <p>You have the privileged opportunity every day, of making a <strong>direct &amp; positive impact on the</strong> <strong>lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo</strong>, I now deliver<strong>&nbsp;</strong>mostly as a single <strong>Consultant</strong> or <strong>Project Lead</strong>. In the right circumstances, teams of associates have been made possible in the past for larger-scale commissions.</p>
      <p><strong>What I don't do:</strong> I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you to align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership, project or personal strategy.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>I welcome informal and exploratory chats. You can also Tweet me! </strong></p>
      <p>I'm a recovering social media
