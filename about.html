      <h5><strong>The job of <em style="font-weight: bold;">looking</em> ahead, <em style="font-weight: bold;">understanding</em> the external environment,&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">preparing </em>for change and&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">moving</em> ahead has never been more challenging for the Public Sector &amp; their Social Purpose partners.

      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level</p>
      <p><strong>I understand the challenges and the joys of </strong></p>

        <p>inter-agency working, stringent funding criteria, complex stakeholder dynamics</p>

      <p>I trained initially as a Musician, spending many years coaching children, young people &amp; adults in schools, extended service settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, building their capacity &amp; capability for public performance</font>. I hold a BMus. Hons in <strong>Conducting </strong>which seems an odd qualification for strategy and organisational development. But those disciplines are very closely aligned. They pivot on getting the best out of people, and unlocking their potential to collaborate to create the big picture.</p>
      <p><strong></strong>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in 1998</strong> when I took on the artistic programming and business development of a community-led venture in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before I was bitten by the Strategy bug, and soon became a fan of multi-agency working, prompting a move to <strong>St Helens Council</strong> in Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer.</p>
      <p>Boyed on by their incredible commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion &amp; Economic Regeneration, I established the towns first ever cross-agency <strong>Cultural Partnership</strong> and with it, a first <strong>Creative Industries business incubation </strong>programme for <strong>Young People along with</strong>&nbsp;a new <strong>Youth Theatre,</strong> <strong>Disability Arts </strong>Programme,supported by successful bids to the <strong>Standards </strong>Fund, <strong>Arts Council </strong>and <strong>European</strong> <strong>ERDF bids</strong> via Merseyside ACME, lighting the way.</p>
      <p>I delivered a stint at <strong>Arts Council England</strong> as their Regional Officer for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills for the East Region in the early 2000s. Stretching my situational Leadership legs, I led the construction with stakeholders, of ACE East's new three-year Learning &amp; Skills strategy. The regional roll out of major national programmes <strong>Spaces for Sport &amp; the Arts </strong>and <strong>Creative Partnerships, put me to&nbsp;</strong>work alongside large clusters of local authorities.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>However, in life, I believe you must&nbsp;<strong>grow where you are planted</strong>. I was planted in <strong>Oxfordshire </strong>through family circumstance in 2004 and <strong>KindleCo was born</strong>. Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Co Production</strong> is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      <p>It does go rather nicely with <strong>Collaboration</strong>, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle.</p>
      <p>I bring a <strong>unique blend of skills</strong> to what I do.</p>
      <p>I work through KindleCo mostly as a single Consultant or Project Lead. Small teams of associates can be arranged where needed. I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency but work with you to align these functions, within your overall strategy.</p>
