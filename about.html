        <p><em><strong>My commitment to developing the skills and lifechances of Children &amp; Young People is longstanding</strong></em>, <em><strong>along with my belief in advocacy and systems-thinking as agents of change</strong></em></p>
        <p>After a period working through the Cultural Services &amp; Creative Industries on multi-agency projects at local, sub-regional and regional agency levels, I have expanded my practice skills in order to be able to support organisations delivering within complex stakeholder environments on the agendas for <strong>Wellbeing</strong>, <strong>Vulnerable</strong> children, <strong>Mental Health</strong> &amp; <strong>SEND</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am a committed contributor to <strong>Co Production</strong>. I have worked in local government in&nbsp;<em><strong>Family Learning&nbsp;</strong></em>serving some of the most deprived and vulnerable families of the UK. In addition to my earlier teaching practice, I have worked with around 50 LAs both singly and as part of regional partnerships spanning locations <strong>Greater Manchester</strong>, <strong>Merseyside</strong>, <strong>London</strong>, rural <strong>East England</strong> and <strong>Essex</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have led strategic partnerships for St Helens Council including as part of regional finding programmes, held responsibility for a regional portfolio with Arts Council England, and brokered cross-sector and mixed-disciplinary partnerships between public sector, community-led organisations and corporate social responsibility programmes to support Children, Young People &amp; Families.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under the KindleCo banner I have successful bid for contracts from public agencies and cultivated my own clients, both organisations and individuals.</p>

        <p class="center-this-text"><strong></strong>If your wondering if I would provide a good fit with your organisation and its partners, here are some helpful tips about <em>Working Together:</em></p>
        <p><strong>What will we have in common?</strong></p>
        <p>A shared passion, need and / or commitment to delivering against a <em><strong>canvass of public policy</strong></em>, in a <em><strong>mixed economy</strong></em> of providers, under <strong><em>diverse political</em>&nbsp;</strong>leadership, for <em><strong>end-beneficiaries</strong></em> of <em><strong>Children, Young People &amp; Families</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>What work could we do together ? &nbsp;</strong><strong>In a nutshell....<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>deepen an understanding of your external environment, navigate and shape it through policy-response &amp; strategy development</li>
          <li>build meaningful alliances around your purpose through stakeholder engagement and strategic partnerships&nbsp;</li>
          <li>deploy external change as a driver for your own project or organisational development</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What would the outcomes be?</strong></p>
        <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my consultancy is bespoke. But alongside&nbsp; specific task objectives, I strive to build:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Knowledge,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Confidence, Capacity &amp; Capability</strong></li>
          <li><strong></strong>A rounded <strong>360 view of resource development: </strong>this is a "must" in today's fiscal climate,&nbsp; so expect our discussions to include developing objectives around strategic <strong>partnerships</strong>, sector&nbsp;<strong>positioning</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong>, as well as <strong>funding</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div><strong>For <strong>a deeper dive, visit me at</strong> <strong><a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobroad/">LinkedIn</a>. Here are some&nbsp;</strong>examples:</strong>

        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div><strong></strong>I originally trained as a Music Practitioner. &nbsp;It sounds an odd connection to what I do now but actually those disciplines have much in common - team work, coaching for performance, knowing the internal and external environment: making the <em><strong>'bigger picture' </strong></em>more than the sum of its individual parts. Orchestras are communities where hard work, skill, compassion, respect and diversity are the lifeblood. <strong>Collaboration matters</strong>.</div>
