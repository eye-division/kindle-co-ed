        <p>"we are living in times of Revolutionary change....a global revolution....for which there are no precedents...our children are confronting challenges that are unique in human history"</p>
        <h6>(Sir Ken Robinson, Out of Our Minds, 3rd Edition, 2017)</h6>

      <p>The job of<strong> <em style="font-weight: bold;">looking</em> </strong>ahead<strong>, <em style="font-weight: bold;">understanding</em> </strong>the external landscape,<strong>&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">preparing </em></strong>for change,&nbsp;<strong><em style="font-weight: bold;">moving</em> </strong>forward together,<strong> </strong>has never been more challenging for&nbsp;<em><strong>Public Sector </strong></em>&amp;<em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>Social Purpose </strong></em>partners....</p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of <em><strong>societal change</strong> </em>is eye-watering and, in a working environment influenced by <strong><em>public policy</em></strong>, change can be <strong><em>overwhelming</em></strong>.</p>
      <p>It can also be&nbsp;<em><strong>inspiring</strong></em> and full of <em><strong>opportunity</strong></em>.</p>
      <p><strong>KindleCo</strong>&nbsp;exists to help <em><strong>Public Sector &amp; Social Purpose</strong></em> organisations occupied with sector-level change, and their related professionals, meet these challenges:<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Jo Broad </strong>specialises<strong> </strong>in <strong>enabling </strong>organisations, and individual professionals, to find their own<strong> creative</strong>,<strong> meaningful &amp; pragmatic </strong>ways to turn <strong>external change </strong>into a driver for their own <strong>strategic development.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I am values - led &amp; outcomes-driven. My professional watchwords are to work in the spirit of &nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>Collaboration </strong>with<strong>&nbsp;Compassion</strong>, <strong>Courage&nbsp; </strong>&amp;&nbsp;<strong> Creativity</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong></strong><strong><em>I'd like to invite you on a journey ....</em></strong>to build even greater <em><strong>meaning</strong></em>, <em><strong>resilience</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>impact</strong></em> into your work, to strengthen outcomes for your <em><strong>end-beneficiaries</strong></em> and with it, your contribution to <strong><em>systems-change...</em></strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>I believe....</strong></p>
      <p>whether it is nurturing stakeholder buy-in (<strong>we <em>all </em>have stakeholders</strong>), leveraging collaboration (<strong><em>we all engage with organisations</em></strong>), galvanising political will (<em><strong>we all have a voice</strong></em>) or unlocking investment (<em><strong>influence cannot always be counted </strong></em>as money), we <em><strong>all have the opportunity </strong></em>to make a <em><strong>positive impact on the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong></em>.</p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years of working directly with Children &amp; Young People and with the agencies who champion them,</strong> I facilitate, support &amp; enable those working in a Government - influenced business environment to develop themselves strategically. Often, although not exclusively, through enabling collaboration to flourish between organisations, we can add greater depth and impact to your professional work and nurture your own growth &amp; sustainability.</p>
      <p><strong>I aim to build capabilities in others, through:</strong></p>

      <p>Prioritising key <strong>Public Policy </strong>areas<strong>, I bring a love of stakeholder dynamics to activities which foster</strong></p>
      <p><em>Social Inclusion, Lifelong Learning Education &amp; Skills, Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing, Creativity, the Arts</em></p>
      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level.</p>
      <p><strong>I understand the challenges and the joys of </strong>inter-agency working, of stringent funding criteria and of complex stakeholder dynamics.</p>
      <h4>A little bit of professional history ........</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong></strong><b></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>I trained initially as a Musician</strong>, spending many years coaching <strong>children, young people &amp; adults </strong>in schools, extended service settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for public performance</font>. I hold a BMus. Hons in <strong>Conducting </strong>which seems an odd qualification for strategy and organisational development.</p>
      <p>But <strong>those disciplines are very closely aligned</strong>. They pivot on <strong>getting the best out of people</strong>, and <strong>unlocking their potential</strong> to <strong>collaborate </strong>to create a <strong>bigger picture</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong></strong>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in 1998</strong> when I took on the artistic programming and <strong>business development</strong> of a <strong>community-led venture</strong> in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before I was bitten by the multi-agency working bug, prompting a move to <strong>St Helens Council</strong> in Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer.</p>
      <p>Boyed on by that Local Authority's incredible commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion,&nbsp; Prosperity &amp; Mobility, I established the towns first ever cross-agency <strong>Cultural Partnership</strong> and with it, a first <strong>Creative Industries business incubation </strong>programme for <strong>Young People. There followed&nbsp;</strong>a new <strong>Youth Theatre,</strong> <strong>Disability Arts </strong>Programme and successful bids to the government's&nbsp;<strong>Standards </strong>Fund, <strong>Arts Council </strong>and a first dive into ERDF, helping to<strong>&nbsp;l</strong>ight the way.</p>
      <p>I delivered a stint at <strong>Arts Council England</strong>&nbsp;(as their Regional Officer for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills) in the East Region in the early 2000s. Tasked with leading the construction of ACE East's new three-year regional Learning &amp; Skills strategy, and the regional roll out of our national programmes <em>Spaces for Sport &amp; the Arts </em>and <em>Creative Partnerships</em>, put me to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>work alongside large clusters of local authorities.</p>
      <p>A particularly driven CEO, with a robust commitment to in-house CPD and ambition for the Region, enabled me to forge a first corporate cross-sector partnership between <strong>ACE</strong>, <strong>BAA</strong> and the then- <strong>LSC,&nbsp;</strong>forming a <strong>Workforce development programme</strong> with Local Authorities and FE Providers, using the Arts as a delivery mechanism with <strong>NEETs</strong>.</p>
      <p>That saw me through my first direct experience, of a major public agency restructure.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In life, I believe you must&nbsp;<strong>grow where you are planted</strong>. I was planted in <strong>Oxfordshire </strong>through family circumstance in 2004 and <strong>KindleCo was born</strong>.</p>
      <p>Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>Co Production</strong> is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      <p>It does go rather nicely with <strong>Collaboration</strong>, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle.</p>
      <p>I bring a <strong>unique blend of skills</strong> to what I do.</p>
      <h5>I work through KindleCo mostly as a single Consultant or Project Lead. Small teams of associates can be arranged where needed. I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency but work with you to align these functions, within your overall strategy.<strong></strong></h5>
      <h5><strong>I welcome informal and exploratory chats. You can also Tweet me!</strong></h5>
