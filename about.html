      <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Through KindleCo</strong>, <strong>I share experience built over 25 years</strong> in public sector project <strong>design</strong>, <strong>development</strong> of strategic partnerships, <strong>nurture</strong> of stakeholder initiatives and&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>management</b></font><b>&nbsp;</b>of multi-agency programmes.</p>
      <p>I am <strong>passionate</strong> about the value of <strong>collaboration </strong>in Social Purpose work, a committed <strong>advocate</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>equality</strong> of opportunity, lover<strong> </strong>of <strong>systems-change</strong> thinking and <strong>believe</strong> in the <strong>transformative</strong>&nbsp;power of <strong>c</strong><strong>reativity</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>KindleCo specialises in supporting our sector champions </strong>in the key Public Policy areas of&nbsp;<strong>Social Inclusion</strong>, Lifelong <strong>Learning</strong> (Education &amp; Skills), <strong>Mental </strong>Health and the <strong>Arts </strong>in their endeavours, specifically -<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Organisational development</strong>, the growth of&nbsp;<strong>collaborative Partnerships</strong>,&nbsp;<strong></strong>the shaping of <strong>P</strong><strong>rojects </strong>as <strong>strategic </strong>interventions and leading <strong>Programme</strong> roll out.</p>
      <p><strong>I strive to enable </strong>the organisations &amp; individuals who keep the <strong>Children &amp; Families </strong>sector afloat, to turn <strong>external change</strong>, into a <strong>driver </strong>for their own strategic <strong>development</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Working with</strong>&nbsp;my four enduring principles of&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em><strong>Collaboration</strong></em>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Compassion</strong></em>, <em><strong>Courage</strong></em> <strong>&amp;</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>Creativity&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
      <p><em><strong></strong></em><strong>KindleCo exists to enable our sector champions to take forward their ambitions:</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;by growing&nbsp;<em><strong>perspective</strong></em>, creating&nbsp;<em><strong>strategy,</strong></em> nurturing&nbsp;<em><strong>capacity&nbsp;</strong></em>and galvanising&nbsp;<strong><em>action</em></strong></p>
      <p>Your work is likely to be delivered in a setting which is&nbsp;<strong>mixed-disciplinary</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;multi-agency</strong>&nbsp;in nature and seeks outcomes which help <strong>build infrastructure</strong> in your sector, organisation, team or individuals.</p>

      <p><strong>For the Public Sector &amp; its Social Purpose partners</strong>, the job of <em>looking</em> ahead, <em>understanding</em>&nbsp;the external landscape,&nbsp;<em>responding</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>moving </em>forward, has never been more challenging<strong></strong></p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of current&nbsp;<strong>societal change </strong>is eye-watering. In environments driven by <strong>public policy</strong>, <strong>it</strong> <strong>can feel</strong>&nbsp;<strong>overwhelming.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>It can also be inspiring and full of opportunity.</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years</strong>, I facilitate, support &amp; enable those working in a Government - influenced business environment, to develop themselves strategically, find opportunity in change and in collaborating with others.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>I</strong><strong><strong> </strong>strive to build agency, self-efficacy &amp; capability in others, through support for:</strong>

      <h3><strong>Expertise</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></h3>
      <h4><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the more than 25 years </strong>of working in, with &amp; through publicly - funded services, organisations, projects and their extended network of business partners</h4>
      <p><strong>If you enjoy a bit of professional history</strong>,<strong> </strong>you can read more of mine&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/Biog_JoBroad_July18f.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;<strong>....</strong>or you can jump straight to my <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/KindleCo_A5_Flyer_DIGITAL (003).pdf">2018 Services Flyer&nbsp;</a></p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>I originally trained as a Musician </strong>and grew up in the English state school &amp; Music Conservatoire systems.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I found these to be a 'place for all', socially -speaking.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><b></b>
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>Professionally</b></font><b>,&nbsp;</b><strong>I spent many years directly coaching</strong> <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adults)&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for public performance.&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>
      </p>
      <p>I furthered my passion for team work with a degree in <strong>Conducting</strong> (yes the baton-waving type, only I never used one of those...) with a dollop of <strong>Research</strong>. I do recognise, this can seem an odd qualification for a later career in developing&nbsp;<strong>Public Sector projects</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Sector Infrastructure</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>O</strong><strong>rganisations.</strong></p>
      <p><i></i><strong>But those disciplines are very closely aligned - success depends on getting the best out of people, cultivating shared endeavour,</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;</span>building&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25em;"></span><strong>structure behind the scenes</strong> and most of all, creating something<strong> collaboratively far greater</strong>, than the sum of the individual parts.....</p>
      <p>Whilst I don't regularly practice in the music field now, I &nbsp;have retained my contact with group professional practice and a commitment to nurturing the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People through work intersecting the policy areas which impact them, notably Learning, Mental Health,&nbsp;<strong>Vulnerable Families</strong> including <strong>SEMH</strong>, the Arts and <strong>Creative Industries</strong>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Working alongside the Public Sector in a strategic capacity</strong>, <strong>and as part of a</strong> <strong>Partnership effort</strong>, began for me in earnest in 1998 and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in one guise or another, I have not left since. Despite its difficult challenges - including all the clammer about funding levels - the Public Sector remains a vibrant place to work, with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong>.</p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <p>You have the privileged opportunity every day, of making a <strong>direct &amp; positive impact on the</strong> <strong>lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo</strong>, I now deliver<strong>&nbsp;</strong>mostly as a single <strong>Consultant</strong> or <strong>Project Lead to government-funded organisations and their key partners</strong>. Teams of associates have been deployed in the past for larger-scale commissions.</p>

      <p><strong>What I don't do:</strong> I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you to align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership, project or personal strategy.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>I welcome informal and exploratory chats. You can also Tweet me! </strong></p>
