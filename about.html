      <p>I originate professionally from the Music sector - a group music coach. I have retained my contact with 'group practice' until the present day through Organisations, along with a firm commitment to nurturing the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</p>
      <p>Focussed now on work which develops provision for&nbsp;<strong>Vulnerable Families </strong>including <strong><strong>Mental Health,&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>SEND</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Creativity </strong>&amp;&nbsp;<strong>the Arts, I work with clients who have an ambition to develop&nbsp;</strong>skills in young people and their supporters, across a broad spectrum of settings</p>

      <p><strong>Working alongside the Public Sector in a strategic capacity</strong>&nbsp;began for me back in the 1990s in the Cultural Sector and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in one guise or another, I have not left since</p>
      <p>Despite its difficult challenges, the Public Sector - and its network of partners in the <strong>Charitable</strong>, <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Voluntary</strong> sectors- remains a vibrant place to work with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong></p>
      <p>And whilst the way we do business and interact has radically altered in that time, the dynamics of <strong>change</strong>, <strong>influence</strong> and shared&nbsp;<strong>purpose</strong> have not: they are still built on the quality of <strong>Relationships</strong></p>
