      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level</p>
      <p><strong>I understand the challenges and the joys of </strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>inter-agency working, stringent funding criteria, complex stakeholder dynamics</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>I trained initially as a Musician, spending many years coaching children, young people &amp; adults in schools, extended service settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, working towards public performances</font>. I furthered my own professional development with a BMus. Hons in <strong>#Conducting</strong>, with a dab of Concert Management, Orchestration and Early Childhood Musical Literacy thrown in for good measure!</p>
      <p>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in 1998</strong> when I took on the artistic programming and business development of a community-led venture in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before I was bitten by the Strategy bug, and soon became a fan of multi-agency working, prompting a move to <strong>St Helens Council</strong> in Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer. Boyed on by their incredible commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion &amp; Economic Regeneration, I established the towns first ever cross-agency <strong>Cultural Partnership</strong> and with it, a first <strong>Creative Industries business incubation </strong>programme for <strong>Young People</strong>.</p>
      <p>It was also a period when we managed to persuade the powers that be to fund a new <strong>Youth Theatre,</strong> <strong>Disability Arts </strong>Programme and contribute to the <strong>Day in the Dome </strong>event marking the Millennium - taking 50 of the regions brightest young talents to London to perform with successful bids to the <strong>Standards </strong>Fund, <strong>Arts Council </strong>and <strong>European</strong> <strong>ERDF bids</strong> via Merseyside ACME, lighting the way.</p>
      <p>Combining experience of developing strategy in multi-agency contexts, spring-boarding new projects in the Public Sector and life as a former Orchestra Coach, I delivered a stint at <strong>Arts Council England</strong> as their Regional Officer for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills in the early 2000s. This allowed me to stretch my situational Leadership legs, leading the construction with stakeholders, of ACE East's new three-year Learning &amp; Skills strategy, alongside the regional roll out of major national programmes <strong>Spaces for Sport &amp; the Arts </strong>and <strong>Creative Partnerships, </strong>working with clusters of local authorities sub-regionally. It is a time I look back on with great joy as a professional and great pride as a colleague.</p>

        <p>In life, I believe you can <strong>grow where you are planted</strong>. I was planted in <strong>Oxfordshire </strong>through family circumstance in 2004 and <strong>KindleCo was born</strong>. Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>#Co Production</strong> is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>It goes rather nicely with the spirit of <strong>#Collaboration</strong>, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I bring a <strong>unique blend of skills</strong> to what I do. I aim to help organisations to collaborate, where this is relevant &amp; meaningful and can add value to their offer. I am experienced and s<strong>killed in the nurture of new projects </strong>and I support&nbsp;<strong>transitions </strong>equally well. I &nbsp;am a great believer in the value too, of <strong>#Stakeholder</strong> relations to organisations which must operate in <strong>Government-influenced</strong> working environment.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Enabling others to experience the value of creating sound, well-informed <strong>#Strategy</strong> as part of wider <strong>#Organisational Development</strong>, is a great personal motivator for me.&nbsp;</p>
