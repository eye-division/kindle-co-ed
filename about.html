      <p>I am <strong>passionate</strong> about the value of <strong>collaboration </strong>in Social Purpose work, a committed <strong>advocate</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>equality</strong> of opportunity, lover<strong> </strong>of <strong>systems-change</strong> thinking and <strong>believe</strong> in the <strong>transformative</strong>&nbsp;power of <strong>c</strong><strong>reativity</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>For the Public Sector &amp; its Social Purpose partners</strong>, the job of <em>looking</em> ahead, <em>understanding</em>&nbsp;the external landscape,&nbsp;<em>responding</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>moving </em>forward, has never been more challenging<strong></strong></p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of current&nbsp;<strong>societal change </strong>is eye-watering. In environments driven by <strong>public policy</strong>, it can feel overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong>It can also be inspiring and<strong> full of opportunity</strong></p>
      <p><strong>With skills honed over more than 25 years</strong>, <strong>I</strong> <strong>facilitate</strong>, <strong>support </strong><strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>enable</strong> those working in a Government - influenced business environment, to develop themselves strategically, find opportunity in change and in collaborating with others.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>I</strong><strong><strong> </strong>strive to build agency, self-efficacy &amp; capability in others, through support for:</strong>

      <p><strong></strong><strong>A little bit about Jo</strong></p>
      <p><strong>My commitment to developing the </strong><strong><strong>s</strong>kills, talents &amp; lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is longstanding</strong>,<strong></strong> along with my belief in advocacy as an agent of change.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I started my first after school club when I was 10 and was reminded recently, that I sent my first letter to a Politician about family-friendly policies, not long before.</p>
      <p><img src="/uploads/leadership--purpose-pic.PNG" /></p>
      <p><strong>I originally trained as a Musician </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>grew up educationally, in the English state school &amp; Music Conservatoire systems.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I found these both to be 'places for all', socially -speaking.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><b></b>
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>Professionally</b></font>,<b>&nbsp;</b><strong>I have spent many years coaching</strong> <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adults)&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for group practice and public performance.&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>I graduated from <em><strong>University of Surrey </strong></em>with a degree in Conducting (yes the baton-waving type, only I never used one of those...) and with a dollop of <strong>Research </strong>into musical literacy as a vehicle for early<strong> childhood development</strong>.</p>
      <p>I recognise, this can seem an odd set of qualifications for a later career in developing&nbsp;<strong>Public Sector projects and</strong>&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"><b>O.D.</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><i></i><strong>But those disciplines are very closely aligned - success depends on getting the best out of people, </strong>cultivating<strong> shared endeavour,</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;design-thinking&nbsp;</span>building&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25em;"></span><strong>structure </strong>behind the scenes and most of all, creating an experience&nbsp;<strong>collaboratively </strong>where the outcome<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is far <strong>greater</strong>&nbsp;<strong>than the sum of the individual parts</strong>.....</p>

      <p>Whilst I don't regularly practice in the music field now, I have retained my contact with group professional practice and a commitment to nurturing the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People. CPD in more recent years has developed my own practitioner skills in work intersecting&nbsp;<strong>Mental Health</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vulnerable Families </strong>and<strong> SEND </strong>along with agency-sensitive qualifications in<strong>&nbsp;Safeguarding</strong>,<strong> Inter- Agency </strong>working,<strong> Mentoring&nbsp;</strong>&amp; <strong>Supervision</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Working alongside the Public Sector in a strategic capacity</strong>&nbsp;began for me back in the 1990s in the Cultural Sector and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in one guise or another, I have not left since.</p>
      <p>Despite its difficult challenges, the Public Sector - and its network of partners in the <strong>Charitable</strong>, <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Voluntary</strong> sectors- remains a vibrant place to work with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong>.</p>
      <p>And whilst the way we do business and interact has radically altered in that time, the dynamics of <strong>change</strong>, <strong>influence</strong> and shared&nbsp;<strong>purpose</strong> have not: they are still built on the quality of <strong>Relationships</strong></p>
      <p><img src="/uploads/children-champion-quote.PNG" /></p>
      <p>We have an opportunity every day to make a direct &amp; positive impact on the <strong>lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong><strong></strong></p>

      <p><strong>Through KindleCo</strong>, I now deliver<strong>&nbsp;</strong>mostly as a single <strong>Consultant</strong> or <strong>Project Lead to government-funded organisations and their key partners</strong>.</p>
