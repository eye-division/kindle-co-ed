      <h2><strong>Expertise</strong></h2>
      <p class="callout center-this-text"><strong style="background-color: white; font-size: 1.25em;">I have worked directly with children, young people &amp; families and with the</strong><span style="background-color: white;"><em style="font-size: 1.25em;">&nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>public sector in&nbsp;</strong><strong>project development and strategic partnerships for over 25 years...</strong></span></span>

      <p><strong>A little more about Jo ....</strong></p>
      <div>My commitment to developing the skills and lifechances of Children &amp; Young People is longstanding, along with my belief in <strong>advocacy and systems-thinking as agents of change</strong>. After a period working through the Cultural Services &amp; Creative Industries on projects at local, sub-regional and regional agency levels, I expanded my practice skills in order to be able to support organisations delivering within complex stakeholder environments on the agendas for <strong>Learning</strong>, <strong>Skills</strong> Development, <strong>Wellbeing</strong>, <strong>Vulnerable</strong> children, <strong>Mental Health</strong> &amp; <strong>SEND</strong>. Creativity and the <strong>Arts</strong> remain close to my professional heart.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" class="cc-active" href="/about/">Back to top</a>&nbsp;or read on...</div>
      <div>I made a move to local government in the 1990s as part of a dynamic Family Learning Team serving some of the most deprived, promoting the lifechances of some of our most vulnerable families. In one way or another, I have not departed the public sector scene since although much of my more recent work sits alongside it, rather than within. It and its network of partners in the <strong>Charity</strong>, <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Voluntary sectors</strong>, make it a vibrant place to engage with the most committed professionals you will ever meet.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>The way we do business in that time has radically altered, but the <strong>dynamics of change</strong>, influence and <strong>shared purpose</strong> are still <strong>built on the same stuff</strong>: the quality of <strong>system-thinking</strong> and of <strong>Relationships</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div><strong> </strong></div>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p class="callout center-this-text">I originally trained as a Music Practitioner. &nbsp;It sounds an odd connection to what I do now, granted, but actually those disciplines have much in common - team work, coaching for performance, knowing the internal and external environment. Making the <em><strong>'bigger picture' </strong></em>more than the sum of its individual parts. Orchestras are communities where hard work, skill, compassion, respect and diversity are the lifeblood. <strong>Collaboration matters</strong>.</p>
