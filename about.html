        <p class="center-this-text">I am committed to the value of <strong>collaboration</strong> in Social Purpose work, an advocate for&nbsp;<strong>equality </strong>of opportunity, believer in <strong>compassion</strong>-led design, lover of <strong>systems-change </strong>thinking and witness to the transformative power of <strong>creativity</strong></p>
        <p class="center-this-text">Through KindleCo, I strive to share experience built over more than 25 years of work with young people, families and, the organisations that support them. I have led the design &amp; development of <strong>strategic programmes</strong> and <strong>cross-boundary projects</strong> in the public sector, supported a range of private clients from <strong>education charities</strong> to <strong>public agencies</strong>, and enabled individual <strong>projects</strong> &amp; <strong>professionals</strong> to reach their goals</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="center-this-text"><em><strong>A little more about Jo .... m</strong><strong style="font-style: italic;">y commitment to developing the lifechances of </strong></em><em><strong style="font-style: italic;">Children &amp; Young People is longstanding</strong></em></p>
        <p class="center-this-text"><em>So is my <strong>belief in collaboration </strong></em>and&nbsp;<em><strong>systems-thinking,</strong> as<strong>&nbsp;agents of change</strong></em></p>
        <p>After a period working through the <strong>Cultural </strong>Services &amp; <strong>Creative </strong>Industries on multi-agency projects at local and regional - agency levels, I have expanded my practice skills in more recent years to be able to support organisations delivering mainstream programmes for&nbsp;<strong>Wellbeing, Learning</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Vulnerable</strong> children</p>
        <p>I am a qualified <em><strong>Mental Health First-Aider </strong></em>(adult) with a passion for Workforce Development</p>
        <p>A committed contributor to the principals of&nbsp;<strong>Co Production -&nbsp;</strong>long before it became fashionable - I have worked in local government in&nbsp;<strong>Family Learning</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>serving some of the most deprived and vulnerable families of the UK.&nbsp; Whether singly, or in strategic roles driving regional partnerships, I have worked with a multitude LAs both in diverse locations spanning&nbsp;<strong>Merseyside</strong>, <strong>Greater Manchester</strong>, <strong>London</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>East England</strong></p>
        <p>I have led strategic intervention work with public agencies including a regional portfolio with Arts Council England, leading the regional roll-out of national programmes. &nbsp;Brokering cross-boundary partnerships between public sector, community-led organisations and private sector organisations gives me a sound grasp of&nbsp;<em><strong>corporate social responsibility</strong></em><strong></strong>&nbsp;and the dynamics of mixed-disciplinary group work.</p>
        <h3 class="center-this-text">IMPACT</h3>
        <p>Successfully influencing decision-makers to create provision and resources to benefit Children &amp; Young People, through collaboration with others, is part of my track record.&nbsp; I firmly believe 'Collaboration' is a value and a behaviour we choose to adopt, not just a process exclusively reserved for those operating at scale</p>
        <p>I also understand the need for <strong>sustainability to remain centre-stage</strong> in Organisational Development and in sector-level change</p>
        <p>I am able to share with clients my experience of winning bids for KindleCo contracts through competitive tendering, of leading <em><strong>successful funding </strong></em>applications to regional programmes on behalf of <em><strong>public agency partnerships,</strong></em> of building successful submissions to <em><strong>Government and European funding </strong></em>pots, such as the Standards Fund, Lottery and delegated ERDF</p>
        <p>Although I do not undertake bid-writing as a stand-alone task, you can be sure I bring to the table experience which enables me to provide well-informed support to clients, in an age where <strong>future-proofing is key</strong>. I will help you ensure your strategic plans take care of the&nbsp;<strong>resources</strong>, <strong>language </strong>and strategic&nbsp;<strong>partnerships</strong> which can promote your <strong>sustainability</strong></p>
        <p>I now also <strong>Coach professionals</strong> working in and alongside the Public Sector in Education and other social purpose settings, to enable successful <strong>workplace transitions.</strong> I love supporting&nbsp;<strong>#carers</strong></p>
        <p>I undertake a small amount of Social Responsibility activity each year. I am currently an active member of the <em><strong>National Children's Bureau </strong></em><a href="/news/"><strong>Family Research Advisory Group</strong></a></p>

        <h2 class="center-this-text"><strong></strong>Working Together</h2>
        <p><strong>What will we have in common?</strong></p>
        <p>A passion, need or commitment to delivering against a <em><strong>canvass of public policy</strong></em>, in a <em><strong>mixed economy</strong></em> of providers, under <strong><em>diverse political</em>&nbsp;</strong>leadership, for <em><strong>end-beneficiaries</strong></em> of <em><strong>Children, Young People &amp; Families</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>What work could we do together ? &nbsp;</strong><strong>In a nutshell....<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>deepen an understanding of your external environment, navigate and shape it through policy-response &amp; strategy development</li>
          <li>build meaningful alliances around your purpose through stakeholder engagement and strategic partnerships&nbsp;</li>
          <li>deploy external change as a driver for your own project or organisational development</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What would the outcomes be?</strong></p>
        <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my consultancy is bespoke. But alongside specific task objectives, I strive to build:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Knowledge,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Confidence, Capacity &amp; Capability</strong></li>
          <li><strong></strong>A rounded <strong>360 view of resource development: </strong>this is a "must" in today's fiscal climate,&nbsp; so expect our discussions to include developing objectives around strategic <strong>partnerships</strong>, sector&nbsp;<strong>positioning</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong>, as well as <strong>funding</strong></li>

        <div class="center-this-text"><strong></strong>I originally trained as a Music Practitioner. &nbsp;It sounds an odd connection to what I do now but actually the process of bringing stakeholders and organisations together, are disciplines which have much in common: team work, coaching behaviours, knowing your internal and external landscape.</div>
