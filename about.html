      <p><strong>For the Public Sector &amp; its Social Purpose partners, the job of <em style="font-weight: bold;">looking</em> ahead, <em>understanding&nbsp;</em>the external landscape,&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">responding&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="font-weight: bold;">moving</em> forward, has never been more challenging</strong></p>
      <p>The nature, pace and scope of <strong>current</strong>&nbsp;<strong>societal change is eye-watering</strong>. In stakeholder-rich environments influenced by <strong>public policy</strong>, it <strong>can feel</strong>&nbsp;<strong>overwhelming, and&nbsp;</strong><strong>inspiring</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>It is also full of opportunity.</strong><strong></strong></p>
      <p>With skills honed over more than 25 years, I facilitate, support &amp; enable those working in a Government - influenced business environment, to develop themselves strategically, find opportunity in change and in working with others.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong></strong>At organisation, team, stakeholder &amp; individual professional levels,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong><strong><strong> </strong>strive to build self-efficacy &amp; capability in others through support for:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Policy - understanding, response, insight &amp; <strong>shaping&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Strategy - creation, interpretation &amp; <strong>execution</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Brokerage - planning, positioning, <strong>enacting</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Systems - thinking, planning &amp; <strong>expression</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg" />&nbsp;<em>Evaluation - reflecting, knowing, <strong>changing</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I share an enduring <strong><font color="#7271a0">commitment</font>&nbsp;&amp; passion for sector dynamics </strong>in the key Policy areas of:</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>Social</strong> Inclusion, Lifelong <strong>Learning</strong> (Education &amp; Skills), Mental <strong>Health</strong>, the Arts and&nbsp;<strong>Creativity&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong><strong>KindleCo</strong>&nbsp;exists to enable our sector champions to take forward their ambitions:</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to build <em><strong>perspective</strong></em>, create <em><strong>strategy</strong></em>, grow <em><strong>capability</strong></em>, galvanise <em><strong>action</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>Jo&nbsp;</strong><strong>specialises in </strong><strong>enabling </strong><strong>organisations&nbsp;</strong>to find ways to turn external change into a driver for their own <strong>strategic development</strong>, working with four enduring principles: -<strong><strong></strong></strong>
      </p>

        <p><strong>Collaboration,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Compassion</strong>, <strong>Courage &amp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Creativity</strong></p>

      <h2>Expertise<strong></strong><strong></strong></h2>
      <h4><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the more than 25 years </strong>of working in, with &amp; through the Public Sector</h4>
      <p><strong>If you enjoy a little bit of professional history</strong>,<strong> </strong>you can mine&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/Biog_JoBroad_July18f.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;<strong>....</strong>or you can jump straight to my <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/KindleCo_A5_Flyer_DIGITAL (003).pdf">2018 Services Flyer&nbsp;</a></p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>I originally trained as a Musician </strong>and grew up in the English Music Conservatoire system.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It was a place for all, socially -speaking.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I spent many years directly coaching <strong>children, young people </strong>(and some adults)&nbsp;<strong></strong>in schools, colleges, in extended services settings and privately, building their capacity &amp; capability for public performance.&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"></font>
      </p>
      <p>After teaching for a while, I furthered my passion for team work with a degree in Conducting (yes the baton-waving type, only I never used one of those...). I appreciate, this can seem an odd qualification for a later career in Public Sector Projects &amp;&nbsp;
        <font color="#7271a0"><b><i>O.D.</i></b></font>
      </p>
      <p><strong>But those disciplines are very closely aligned - </strong><strong>success depends on getting the best out of people</strong>, <strong>cultivating&nbsp;</strong><strong>shared endeavour</strong>, structure behind the scenes, and creating something together which is so much greater than the sum of the individual parts.....</p>
      <p>Working alongside the Public Sector in a strategic capacity, and as part of a Partnership effort, began for me in earnest in 1998.<strong> </strong>In one guise or another, I have not left since.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Despite its difficult challenges - all the clammer about funding levels - the Public Sector remains a vibrant place to work, with the most committed professionals you will ever meet.</p>
        <p>You have the privileged opportunity every day, of making a direct &amp; positive impact, on the lifechances of Children &amp; Young People.</p>
        <p>Equality of opportunity matters a great deal to me.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>I work now through KindleCo </strong>mostly as a single <strong>Consultant</strong> or <strong>Project Lead</strong>. Small teams of associates can be arranged where needed.</p>
      <p><strong>What I don't do:</strong> I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you to align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership, project or personal strategy.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>I welcome informal and exploratory chats. You can also Tweet me!</strong></p>
