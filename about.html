      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p><strong>Through KindleCo, I share experience gained over the past 25+ years </strong>of working in &amp; with the Public Sector at local, regional and sector level</p>

      <p><strong>I trained initially as a Musician</strong>, spending many years coaching <strong>children, young people &amp; adults </strong>in schools, extended service settings and
        <font color="#7271a0">privately, <strong>building their capacity &amp; capability</strong> for public performance</font>. I hold a BMus. Hons in <strong>Conducting </strong>which seems an odd qualification for strategy and organisational development.</p>
      <p>But <strong>those disciplines are very closely aligned</strong>. They pivot on <strong>getting the best out of people</strong>, and <strong>unlocking their potential</strong> to <strong>collaborate </strong>to create a <strong>bigger picture</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong></strong>I entered the realms of&nbsp; working alongside the <strong>Public Sector in 1998</strong> when I took on the artistic programming and <strong>business development</strong> of a <strong>community-led venture</strong> in West London, developing its first ever Outreach Programme for Arts &amp; Community Education.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before I was bitten by the multi-agency working bug, prompting a move to <strong>St Helens Council</strong> in Merseyside in 1998 to be their first ever Arts Officer.</p>
      <p>Boyed on by that Local Authority's incredible commitment to Learning as a tool for Social Inclusion,&nbsp; Prosperity &amp; Mobility, I established the towns first ever cross-agency <strong>Cultural Partnership</strong> and with it, a first <strong>Creative Industries business incubation </strong>programme for <strong>Young People. There followed&nbsp;</strong>a new <strong>Youth Theatre,</strong> <strong>Disability Arts </strong>Programme and successful bids to the government's&nbsp;<strong>Standards </strong>Fund, <strong>Arts Council </strong>and a first dive into ERDF, helping to<strong>&nbsp;l</strong>ight the way.</p>
      <p>I delivered a stint at <strong>Arts Council England</strong>&nbsp;(as their Regional Officer for Lifelong Learning &amp; Skills) in the East Region in the early 2000s. Tasked with leading the construction of ACE East's new three-year regional Learning &amp; Skills strategy, and the regional roll out of our national programmes <em>Spaces for Sport &amp; the Arts </em>and <em>Creative Partnerships</em>, put me to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>work alongside large clusters of local authorities.</p>
      <p>A particularly driven CEO, with a robust commitment to in-house CPD and ambition for the Region, enabled me to forge a first corporate cross-sector partnership between <strong>ACE</strong>, <strong>BAA</strong> and the then- <strong>LSC,&nbsp;</strong>forming a <strong>Workforce development programme</strong> with Local Authorities and FE Providers, using the Arts as a delivery mechanism with <strong>NEETs</strong>.</p>
      <p>That saw me through my first direct experience, of a major national public agency restructure.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In life, I believe you must&nbsp;<strong>grow where you are planted</strong>. I was planted in <strong>Oxfordshire </strong>through family circumstance in 2004 and <strong>KindleCo was born</strong>.</p>
      <p>Two gorgeous children have followed and what a time this has been!&nbsp;<strong></strong><strong>Co Production</strong> is now a personal &amp; professional watchword.</p>
      <p>It does go rather nicely with <strong>Collaboration</strong>, which given the Orchestral starting point, brings me full circle.</p>
      <p>I bring a <strong>unique blend of skills</strong> to what I do.</p>
      <p>I work through KindleCo mostly as a single Consultant or Project Lead. Small teams of associates can be arranged where needed. I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency but work with you to align these functions, within your overall strategy.</p>
