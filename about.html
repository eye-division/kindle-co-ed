      <p><strong></strong><strong>A little bit about Jo ....</strong></p>
      <p><strong>My commitment to developing the </strong><strong><strong>s</strong>kills, talents &amp; lifechances of Children &amp; Young People</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is longstanding</strong>,<strong></strong> along with my belief in advocacy as an agent of change.</p>
      <p>I
        <font color="#7271a0">believe</font>&nbsp;success depends on getting the best out of people... and letting them get the best out of you...<strong></strong>I originally trained as a Music Practitioner, spending many years as a group music coach and rehearsing Orchestras ready for performance. In that discipline, cultivating<strong> shared endeavour, &nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">design-thinking</span>&nbsp;is the essence of the work.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In more recent years, and following a decade or so working in and with Cultural Services, I have honed my skills in work which develops projects, provision, or infrastructure around<strong>&nbsp;Families,</strong>&nbsp;<strong><strong>Mental Health,&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong>SEND</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Creativity </strong>and the <strong>Arts.&nbsp;</strong>I love to work with clients who have an ambition to develop their sector role in growing lifechances of young people. And I am a fan of advocacy, which has led me to Coaching and an interest in the role of Consultancy within Organisations. In 2016 I gained my first accreditation from the <em><strong>EMCC</strong></em> in <strong><em>S</em></strong><em><strong>upervision of <font color="#7271a0">Consultants</font>, Coaches and Mentors</strong><b> </b></em>in the workplace.</p>

      <p><strong>The move from practitioner to strategist in the Public Sector</strong>&nbsp;began for me back in the 1990s when I moved to a Local Authority on Merseyside to work a Family Learning team, promoting the lifechances of vulnerable families through skills-building. In one guise or another, I have not left since. Despite its difficult challenges, the Public Sector - and its network of partners in the <strong>Charitable</strong>, <strong>Social Enterprise</strong> and <strong>Voluntary</strong> sectors- remains a vibrant place to work with the<strong> most committed professionals you will ever meet</strong></p>
