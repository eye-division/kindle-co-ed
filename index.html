      </em>
      </em><em><em><strong>Children, Young People &amp; Families to reach their goals and thrive. </strong></em></em>
    </h4>
    <div><em><strong>Established by me, Jo Broad&nbsp; in 2004, </strong><strong>KindleCo provides specialist consultancy, coaching and bespoke project management&nbsp;</strong>to those organisations, projects and professionals who are driven by social purpose but must deliver against a backdrop of public policy.</em></div>

    <h4><i>Using over 25 years of first-hand experience of coaching Children &amp; Young People themselves, and of delivering large-scale projects with the agencies that support them,&nbsp;</i><em>I understand what drives the workforce and the organisational challenges our children's champions face.</em><em></em></h4>
    <p><em>Perhaps you are a <strong>CEO of a small charity</strong>&nbsp;who needs to reconcile the internal needs of your organisation with the bigger sector picture outside ?</em></p>
    <p><em>Or a <strong>Project Manager </strong>of a multi-agency initiative with complex stakeholder relationships you must align, as you strive to get the best outcomes for your end-beneficiaries ?</em></p>
    <p><strong><em>I can connect with the challenges you and your stakeholders face in getting the best for your Children &amp; Young People on a very real level. </em></strong><em>I will bring expert knowledge, compassion and insight to the task of both opportunity spotting and managing risk in your projects, building your confidence and capabilities as you navigate your way around our constantly evolving, government-influenced eco-system of a sector.</em></p>
    <h3><em><strong>Not an organisation? </strong><strong>Don't go away....&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
    <p><em>I also help a small number of&nbsp;<strong>committed individuals</strong>, through Coaching, who are directly supporting young people to develop their life- goals.&nbsp; Reconciling your own needs and aspirations whilst enabling Children &amp; Young People to meet theirs, can be tough.&nbsp;</em><em>As a Coach with insight borne of experience, I will strike the right balance between compassion and challenge in our work together, to help you find your own way forward.</em></p>
    <h4><em><strong>Four professional values, drive all my work:&nbsp;</strong></em></h4>
