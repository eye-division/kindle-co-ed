      <h4 class="center-this-text"><strong>As of August 2024:</strong></h4>
      <h4 class="center-this-text">I will be focussing my energies on Coaching &amp; Mentoring, retaining my specialisism in helping clients to master change and thrive.&nbsp; </h4>
      <p class="center-this-text">Supporting others affect change, has long formed an integral aspect element of my professional activities, within all my previous Employed and Consultancy roles, and adopting a Coaching approach, has been central to that. I have been fortunate to have Coached some amazing individuals under the banner of KindleCo in the last 20 years, in addition to my Consultancy assignments, including parent-carers and professionals supporting children &amp; young people, successfully enabling them to find opportunity in change and set themselves a new direction of travel for their next chapters. As I set the direction for my own next chapter, Organisational Concultancy will be taking more of a back seat, allowing me to invest in individual clients, through 1:1 Coaching, Mentoring and Consultations.&nbsp;</p>
