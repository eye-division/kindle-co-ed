    <h3>Testimonials from Consultancy &amp; Coaching</h3>
    <h3>Personal &amp; Professional Change in the worlds of Health, Education, Social Care, Cultural Industries &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>
    <p class="callout"><strong>Staying abreast of significant change in the complex eco-system</strong>&nbsp;<strong>surrounding my stakeholders</strong>, <strong>is fundamental to the success of my role </strong>in the Health Outcomes.<strong> </strong>KindleCo brought me straight up to speed on recent changes at national level but also brought valuable insights borne out of experience to the table. <strong>Jo's ability to interpret and anticipate</strong>&nbsp;the ways in which the Public Sector might work with its partner agencies going forward, was incredibly valuable in my business planning. Tailored and digestible, the support was insight-rich, when I was time poor.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Founder &amp; Director, Inspired Health Outcomes, <strong>Oxford 2023</strong></em></p>
    <p class="callout full-width-text">Jo fortuitously crossed my radar over five years ago when I was both a <strong><em>safeguarding governor </em></strong>of a primary School and&nbsp;<em><strong>trustee of a young person’s charity</strong></em>. She has been an <em>outstanding<strong> sounding board</strong></em>, deftly using<em>&nbsp;her knowledge of the role of policy in organisations, to <strong>help navigate a route around&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>the firewalls</strong> that public bodies sometimes unintentionally, create. An outstanding Consultant to both organisations and individuals supporting Children &amp; Young People. She is a breath of fresh air....................<em><strong>(Rob Barton, Trustee, Education Charity and Director of RBA Search, Oxfordshire 2022)</strong></em></p>
    <p class="callout"><em><strong>As a Coach, Jo was able to help me see that the change I was experiencing as all-consuming,&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>didn't have to define me. </strong></em>That I could get back in touch with capabilities I had actually had, but had either ignored or dismissed myself, as 'not valuable'. The self-sabotage was out the window by the end of our time together. But I never felt 'judged'. Jo is compassionate and empathetic as well as highly practical, at getting those 'next steps' laid down in black &amp; white. Just go for it! <em><strong>(Martha - Coachee, 2023)</strong></em></p>
