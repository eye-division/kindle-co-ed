In a reflective piece, I seek to explore some of the systems-level inequities built in to the national resources, agency infrastructures and working practices around adults who support Vulnerable Children and those with SEND and ask: where do parent-carers fit in ?

When new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government back in 2015, its arrival was marked by **an excellent event hosted by** [**NCB**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/). Contributors from **DfE** and **DoH** came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, and from the 'big three' of&nbsp;**Health**, **Education** and **Social Care**.

However there was nothing on the formal Agenda,&nbsp; and little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables, on the support that might be needed for the adults, working directly with these vulnerable children.

> **No-one tabled the question:** *how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?***In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds** with the realities so many adults face, in the course of our daily task.

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which is focused on their own wellbeing. There is a lack of support which is&nbsp;**systematised, rooted in evidence-based practice, and aims to help all the adults involved.**&nbsp;At least not one which is equitable in its access.

What support there is, tends to be **lopsided in who can access it:****arms-length counselling** for individuals accessible via a GP, perhaps. But these services are fundamentally **disconnected to the 'Team' environment**.&nbsp;**Social Workers** and **Clinicians** attending that day back in 2015, were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including '***Supervision***'. But by and large, **Education professionals** were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.&nbsp;**Foster Carers** were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; **Adoptive Parents** felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.&nbsp;

*Then there were* ***Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero, systemically-speaking.*&nbsp;There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers,** despite many parents of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently. Carers of young people with **SEN**, **Disabilities** or with enduring **Health** needs, typically have to pitch up to a publically-funded statutory agency setting, numerous times a year. These encounters &nbsp;can be great: enriching, helpful and effective. But it has turned out to be for some folk I know to be an experience, which is opposite to&nbsp; that.

Truth to be told, there were not many Parent - Carers at the event. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidanceâ€¦. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined. I thoroughly enjoyed myself in a professional capacity, having not long before, stepped back into the workplace after a hugely extended stint on maternity leave.&nbsp;

But in families whose **children live at home** and are indeed **highly Vulnerable**, what happens to the **mental state of the adults**&nbsp;when they find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** of both child's **emotional needs** at home, and the '**services**' negotiating grounds? It can feel like a strange altered reality especially if you are new to it all.

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware through my professional work and the community circles I move in, of the toll it takes those adults (any adult) supporting vulnerable children directly. Many parent-carers, given a suitably "safe space" - (i.e.&nbsp;**non-judgemental, non-pathologising**)- would say, **it's a massive challenge**. That's partly because the toll it takes on a vulnerable child, just trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, is immense. That's regardless of self-efficacy, quality of professional input, levels of resilience and eventual outcomes. And i**f it is immense for the child, it's often immense for the adult. There is no weakness in acknowledging that, or at least, there shouldn't be.**

The vast majority of parents, Corporate and otherwise, want to meet these challenges in full: selflessly, with gusto and effectively as an agent for that child's own life ambitions. Yet it struck me so much that day back in 2015, and many times since, how much we lack a national system which helps all the relevant adults process this work emotionally.&nbsp;

There are providers out there, doing some fantastic work with Professionals and with Families in a very holistic way (***MBO in Oxfordshire*** and the ***Anna Freud Centre* in London to name but two). But nothing which our national systems supports**, which truly responds to the daily reality of who does what in a Team around a Child when they are **unwell, not thriving** and living at home. Its a shared endeavour. Friends are good (especially those that are treading a similar path) but there are limits to what mates can do for each other.&nbsp;

N**ot that parent-carers mind this, but when it's the only mode of interaction with public agencies, being repeatedly asked minus any actual support, can get a little wearing. There is valued on-line guidance on which P-Cs can call for help in working the system. But that is not quite the same thing.

**For many parent-carers, there is a need to process the emotions that come up when you feel:**

* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)&nbsp;**de-skilled** around your child: parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given by professionals, or which they train themselves in, to support an aspect of their child's development;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)**disempowered** in an agency meeting: this can happen when professionals are discussing what they will, and won't, give your child according to assessment of need and increasingly, available resources; &nbsp;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)***empathy***&nbsp;**vs. frustration**&nbsp;- a mixed bag of emotion that seeps into your brain on leaving a conversation with an otherwise skilled, dedicated but over-worked,&nbsp;**under-resourced public sector professional** whose just failed to implement a key part of your child's support plan. Parents have to tackle that head on for their child's sake but, how ever carefully constructed the approach, addressing that frequently does not go down well.

Usually, professionals at the table have some sort of peer group, line management or the staff room from which to draw support afterwards; there are colleagues with whom to refresh strategy, for the next meeting.&nbsp;

Parent -carers frequently exit those encounters alone. However cohesive your own home, it is not always the best or appropriate receptacle for dumping&nbsp; 'agency overspill' into, 10 times a year.

One must recognise too, that Public Sector leaders must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That comes with an emotional cost, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets. No-one goes into **Corporate Parenting**&nbsp;because they enjoy saying 'no' to families...

They are more likely than parents to access support for the work they do to discharge their duties around vulnerable children, although I suspect increasingly, do not have the time.

I should add that **NCB**,&nbsp; as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation **most definitely banging the drum of Co Production elsewhere with and for parent-carers.** So, no criticism implied of the 2015 event.&nbsp;

**Over the past 10 years, I have begun** (or been put on)**&nbsp;*a journey of 'curious enquiry'*&nbsp;**as I go about my daily life and business. I am fortunate to have a relationship with a range of organisations, stakeholder groups and dedicated individuals (including parents) who experience the highs and lows of supporting vulnerable children. &nbsp; A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building of professional - stakeholder - personal perspectives.&nbsp;

It's multi-faceted, colourful and sometimes overwhelming but **it's a kaleidoscope view&nbsp;**I committed to **deploying for the greater good**, wherever possible.

**There is a debate to be had nationally,** about how to resource and **systematize the maintaining of wellbeing for ALL adults in a team** **around a child, s**o that they remain healthy, objective and able to stay the course with the child without frazzling away into oblivion.

Experts would refer to [**Psychodynamic Theory ,**](__notset__)&nbsp;Reflective and Relational[&nbsp;](__notset__)Practice. But to many parents, this would simply be about 'team skills'&nbsp; and 'Mental Health'.&nbsp;**Local Authority *Early Help***&nbsp;'offers' seem extremely variable. Parent-carers can find these very off -putting because the entire process sits in a Safeguarding frame. Engagement is frequently led by professionals used to driving any 'assessment' of Help, through the lens of Child Protection.&nbsp; Google a few randomly selected examples on 'Early Help' for families and you will find some LAs are much more welcoming in their tone, than others.

**Left unchecked** and unprocessed, the emotional load&nbsp; brought up when contributing as a professional, or as a parent around the table, can be&nbsp;**a route to ill health for the adult. With that**&nbsp;comes poorer outcomes for the child. A **national offer is therefore needed which is equitable in its access** and includes Parent's and Teachers' Wellbeing, alongside Clinicians & Social Workers. It should not be workplace or seniority -specific and needs to be able to sit&nbsp;**outside of Child Protection.**

It's about supporting the professional-level practice skills and, the emotional load demanded of all Team members around a child, regardless of their formal 'job' title.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector, as well as with Parent-Carers, to raise awareness of this issue and seek to trigger a **systems-level intervention**.
