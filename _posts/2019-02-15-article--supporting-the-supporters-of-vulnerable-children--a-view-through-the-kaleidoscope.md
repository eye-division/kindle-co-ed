In a reflective piece, I seek to explore some of the systems-level inequities built in to the national resources, agency infrastructures and working practices around adults who support Vulnerable Children and those with SEND, and ask: where do parent-carers fit in ?

For anyone who enjoys a bit of a **gander through systems-change thinking**, read on. If not, I'd go make a cup of tea…..

When new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government back in 2015, its arrival was marked by **an excellent event hosted by** [**NCB**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/). Contributors from **DfE** and **DoH** came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, and from the 'big three' of&nbsp;**Health**, **Education** and **Social Care**.

However there was nothing on the formal Agenda,&nbsp; and little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables, on the support that might be needed for the adults, working directly with these vulnerable children.

> **No-one tabled the question:** *how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?***In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds** with the realities so many adults face, in the course of our daily task.&nbsp;

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many adults fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which is focused on their own wellbeing, mental and emotional health.There is a distinct lack of support which is in any way&nbsp;**systematised, not informal, rooted in evidence-based practice and recognises the needs of all the adults involved, equally.**&nbsp;What does exist is not equitable in its access and even where it is accesable (for example via a GP referral), these services are fundamentally **disconnected to the 'Team' environment** which throws up the issues around the table when meeting to discuss a child. &nbsp;**Social Workers** and **Clinicians** attending that day back in 2015, were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including '***Supervision***'. **Education professionals** were not - a supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.&nbsp;**Foster Carers** seemed more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; **Adoptive Parents** felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.&nbsp;

*Then there were* ***Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero, systemically-speaking.*&nbsp;There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers,** despite many parents of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently.

Carers of young people with **SEN**, **Disabilities** or with enduring **Health** needs, typically have to pitch up to a publically-funded statutory agency setting, numerous times a year. These encounters &nbsp;can be great: enriching, helpful and effective. But the experience of some parent-carers is that these occasions can be the opposite to&nbsp; that.&nbsp;

Truth to be told, there were not many Parent - Carers at the event. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance…. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined. Its important to say clearly here that **NCB,&nbsp;** as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation **most definitely banging the drum of support with and for&nbsp;****parent-carers**. If you're interested to know more, you view some of NCB's work with parent-carers&nbsp;**via the video link above**. There is really&nbsp;**no criticism implied in what I am saying of the 2015 gathering.**

But it was perhaps reflective of this uneven national picture, that the emotional wellbeing of adults (especially parent-carers) in teams - around - the - child, was not on the Agenda.

So what does happen in families whose **children live at home** and are **highly Vulnerable**, to the **mental state of the adults?**&nbsp;They find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** of both child's **emotional needs** at home, and the **services**&nbsp;'negotiating ground'**.** It can feel like a strange sort of altered reality, especially if you are new to it all. In the past decade, I have become acutely aware through my professional work and the community circles I move in, of the toll it takes those adults (any adult) supporting vulnerable children directly.

Many parent-carers, given a suitably "safe space" - (i.e.&nbsp;**non-judgemental, non-pathologising**)- would say, **it's a massive challenge**. That's partly because the toll it takes on a vulnerable child, just trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, is immense. If it' s immense for the child, chances are, it's likely to be immense for the adult. That's regardless of&nbsp; levels of self-efficacy, quality of professional input, or eventual outcomes. The 'resilience' argument only goes so far because even when the eventual outcomes are great, it can still knock you. There is no weakness in acknowledging that, or at least, there shouldn't be.

&nbsp;

When a child is&nbsp;**unwell**&nbsp;***and* living at home,** friends are good at supporting, especially those that are treading a similar path. But there are limits to what mates can do for each other.&nbsp;***There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee***.

For many parent-carers, **there is a need to process the emotions that come up when you feel:**

* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)&nbsp;**de-skilled** around your child: parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given by professionals, or which they train themselves in, to support an aspect of their child's development;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)**disempowered** in an agency meeting: this can happen when professionals are discussing what they will, and won't, give your child according to assessment of need and increasingly, available resources; &nbsp;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)***empathy***&nbsp;**vs. frustration**&nbsp;- a mixed bag of emotion that seeps into your brain on leaving a conversation with an otherwise skilled, dedicated but over-worked,&nbsp;**under-resourced public sector professional** whose just failed to implement a key part of your child's support plan. Parents have to tackle that head on for their child's sake but, how ever carefully constructed the approach, **addressing that frequently does not go down well**. If you think organisations would never react subjectively, think again, they can and do. I guess we are all human.

After multi-party meetings, professionals usually have some sort of peer group, line management or staff room to go back to from which to draw support - colleagues perhaps with whom to refresh strategy, for the next meeting. Parent -carers usually exit those encounters alone. However cohesive your own home, it is not always the best or appropriate receptacle for dumping&nbsp; 'agency overspill' into, 10 times a year.

Public Sector leaders too must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That surely comes with an emotional cost, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets. No-one goes into **Corporate Parenting**&nbsp;because they enjoy saying 'no' to families…

**What about Local Authority Early Help&nbsp;**offers for Families?

These are ostensibly provided to support families with a child with complex health or Disability. But to me they seem extremely variable. **Parent-carers can find these very off -putting** because the entire process sits in a **Safeguarding** frame. Engagement is frequently led by professionals used to driving any 'assessment' of Help, **through the lens of Child Protection**.&nbsp; Google a few randomly selected examples on 'Early Help' -&nbsp; you will find some Local Authorities are much more welcoming in their tone, than others.

**So, over the past 10 years, I have begun****&nbsp;*a journey of 'curious enquiry'*&nbsp;**as I go about my daily life and business. I am fortunate to have a relationship with a range of organisations, stakeholder groups and dedicated individuals (including parents) who experience the highs and lows of supporting vulnerable children. &nbsp; A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building, of p**rofessional - stakeholder - personal perspectives.&nbsp;**It's multi-faceted, colourful and sometimes overwhelming but **it's a kaleidoscope view, and &nbsp;**I'm committed to **deploying it for the greater good.**

**I believe there is a debate to be had nationally**&nbsp;about how to resource and&nbsp;**systematise equally, the maintaining of wellbeing for ALL adults in a team** **around a child.&nbsp;**If they remain healthy, objective and able to stay the course with the child without frazzling away into oblivion, it benefits everyone. Early Intervention and prevention, is surely the way to go.&nbsp;

Experts might refer to the need to raise awareness of psycho-dynamic theory and the benefits of&nbsp;**Reflective practice.** Many parents would simply call it the need for 'team skills' and stress management. I think at sector-level, it is even more basic: its the the need for systems which actively promote **equal Value**&nbsp;of all participants around the support table.

A **national offer is therefore needed which is equitable in its access** and includes Parent and Teachers Wellbeing, alongside Clinicians and Social Workers. It should not be workplace or seniority -specific and needs to be able to sit&nbsp;**outside of Child Protection.**&nbsp;Something that supports all Team members around a child - regardless of their formal 'job' title.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services as well as with Parent-Carers, in building awareness of this issue.&nbsp;*If you* ***would like to talk to me about 'supporting the supporters' of vulnerable children and young people,&nbsp;****get in touch.*

**I'm all ears.**
