In a reflective piece, I seek to explore some of the systems-level inequities built in to the national resources, agency infrastructures and working practices around adults who support Vulnerable Children and those with SEND and ask: where do parent-carers fit in ?

For anyone who enjoys a bit of a **gander through systems-change thinking**, read on. If not, I'd go make a cup of tea.....

When new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government back in 2015, its arrival was marked by **an excellent event hosted by** [**NCB**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/). Contributors from **DfE** and **DoH** came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, and from the 'big three' of&nbsp;**Health**, **Education** and **Social Care**.

However there was nothing on the formal Agenda,&nbsp; and little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables, on the support that might be needed for the adults, working directly with these vulnerable children.

> **No-one tabled the question:** *how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?***In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds** with the realities so many adults face, in the course of our daily task.

I will say clearly here that **NCB,&nbsp;** as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation **most definitely banging the drum of Co Production** elsewhere with and for,&nbsp;**parent-carers**. So, **no criticism implied of the 2015 gathering**. You can see more of their work with parent-carers, **via the video link above**.

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which is focused on their own wellbeing. There is a lack of support which is&nbsp;**systematised, rooted in evidence-based practice, and aims to help all the adults involved.**&nbsp;At least not one which is equitable in its access.

What support there is, tends to be **lopsided in who can access it:****arms-length counselling** for individuals accessible via a GP, perhaps. But these services are fundamentally **disconnected to the 'Team' environment**.&nbsp;**Social Workers** and **Clinicians** attending that day back in 2015, were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including '***Supervision***'. But by and large, **Education professionals** were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.&nbsp;**Foster Carers** were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; **Adoptive Parents** felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.&nbsp;

*Then there were* ***Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero, systemically-speaking.*&nbsp;There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers,** despite many parents of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently. Carers of young people with **SEN**, **Disabilities** or with enduring **Health** needs, typically have to pitch up to a publically-funded statutory agency setting, numerous times a year. These encounters &nbsp;can be great: enriching, helpful and effective. But it has turned out to be for some folk I know to be an experience, which is opposite to&nbsp; that.

Truth to be told, there were not many Parent - Carers at the event. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance…. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined.&nbsp;

But in families whose **children live at home** and are indeed **highly Vulnerable**, what happens to the **mental state of the adults?**&nbsp;When they find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** of both child's **emotional needs** at home, and the **services**&nbsp;'negotiating ground', **it can feel quite immense.** It can feel like a strange sort of altered reality, especially if you are new to it all.

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware through my professional work and the community circles I move in, of the toll it takes those adults (any adult) supporting vulnerable children directly. Many parent-carers, given a suitably "safe space" - (i.e.&nbsp;**non-judgemental, non-pathologising**)- would say, **it's a massive challenge**. That's partly because the toll it takes on a vulnerable child, just trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, is immense. And if it is immense for the child, it's often immense for the adult, regardless of self-efficacy, quality of professional input, levels of resilience or eventual outcomes.

Even when the Outcomes are great, its can still knock you.

**There is no weakness in acknowledging that, or at least, there shouldn't be.**

The vast majority of parents, Corporate and otherwise, want to meet these challenges in full- selflessly, with gusto and effectively, as an agent for that child's own life ambitions.&nbsp;

There are providers out there, doing some fantastic work with Professionals and with Families in a very holistic way.&nbsp;**But nothing which our national systems supports**, which truly responds to the daily reality of who does what in a Team around a Child. Especially not when they are **unwell**&nbsp;***and* living at home**.

Friends are good (especially those that are treading a similar path) but there are limits to what mates can do for each other.&nbsp;***There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee***. For many parent-carers, **there is a need to process the emotions that come up when you feel:**

* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)&nbsp;**de-skilled** around your child: parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given by professionals, or which they train themselves in, to support an aspect of their child's development;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)**disempowered** in an agency meeting: this can happen when professionals are discussing what they will, and won't, give your child according to assessment of need and increasingly, available resources; &nbsp;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)***empathy***&nbsp;**vs. frustration**&nbsp;- a mixed bag of emotion that seeps into your brain on leaving a conversation with an otherwise skilled, dedicated but over-worked,&nbsp;**under-resourced public sector professional** whose just failed to implement a key part of your child's support plan. Parents have to tackle that head on for their child's sake but, how ever carefully constructed the approach, **addressing that frequently does not go down well**. If you think organisations would never react subjectively with petulance, think again.&nbsp;

After multi-party meetings and family conferences, professionals at the table usually have some sort of peer group, line management or staff room from which to draw support; colleagues perhaps with whom to refresh strategy, for the next meeting.&nbsp;

\*\*Parent -carers frequently exit those encounters alone. \*\*

However cohesive your own home, it is not always the best or appropriate receptacle for dumping&nbsp; 'agency overspill' into, 10 times a year.

One must recognise too, that Public Sector leaders must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That comes with an emotional cost, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets. No-one goes into **Corporate Parenting**&nbsp;because they enjoy saying 'no' to families…

They are more likely than parents to access support for the work they do to discharge their duties around vulnerable children, although I suspect increasingly, do not have the time.

**What about Local Authority Early Help&nbsp;**offers then I hear you say?

These are ostensibly provided to support families with a child with complex health or Disability. But to me they seem extremely variable. **Parent-carers can find these very off -putting** because the entire process sits in a **Safeguarding** frame. Engagement is frequently led by professionals used to driving any 'assessment' of Help, **through the lens of Child Protection**.&nbsp; Google a few randomly selected examples on 'Early Help' -&nbsp; you will find some LAs are much more welcoming in their tone, than others.

**Over the past 10 years, I have begun** (or been put on)**&nbsp;*a journey of 'curious enquiry'*&nbsp;**as I go about my daily life and business. I am fortunate to have a relationship with a range of organisations, stakeholder groups and dedicated individuals (including parents) who experience the highs and lows of supporting vulnerable children. &nbsp; A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building of professional - stakeholder - personal perspectives.&nbsp;

It's multi-faceted, colourful and sometimes overwhelming but **it's a kaleidoscope view&nbsp;**I committed to **deploying for the greater good**, wherever possible.

**There is a debate to be had nationally,** about how to resource and&nbsp;**systematise the maintaining of wellbeing for ALL adults in a team** **around a child, s**o that they remain healthy, objective and able to stay the course with the child without frazzling away into oblivion.&nbsp; Whilst experts might refer to **Psycho-dynamic theory** and&nbsp;**Reflective practice**, many parents would simply call it 'team skills', 'emotional health' and stress management.

Sometimes it is even more basic: the need for systems to promote **equal Value** and enable **mutual Respect**.

**Left unchecked** and unprocessed, the emotional load&nbsp; brought up for adults when contributing as a professional, or as a parent, around the agency table can be&nbsp;**a route to ill health.****With that, comes poorer outcomes for the child**.

A **national offer is therefore needed which is equitable in its access** and includes Parent's and Teachers' Wellbeing, alongside Clinicians & Social Workers. It should not be workplace or seniority -specific and needs to be able to sit&nbsp;**outside of Child Protection.**&nbsp;Something that supports the practice skills and the emotional load demanded of all Team members around a child - regardless of their formal 'job' title.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services as well as with Parent-Carers, in building awareness of this issue.
