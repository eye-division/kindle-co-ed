Spring 2017 saw the journey of **"Putting Children First"** (the Government's policy paper on Vulnerable Children published in July'16) reach the end of its Parliamentary journey. It was granted Royal Assent on 27th April becoming the Children &amp; Social Work Act.

The Act should bring new statutory imperatives for the whole-sector:

**Regional and sub-regional commissioning of services:** a need for collaborative working across traditional Public Sector geographical boundaries

**A mixed economy of providers:** including increased collaboration in service delivery with Charities

**'Sector - led' models of organisational improvement:** predicated on ‘peer to peer’ support and taking learning from the Education Sector

**Adoption of  ‘Corporate Parenting Principles’:**  to govern a whole – organisation approach at Local Authority level to promoting the interests of vulnerable children, with its key agency partners in **Education, Health, Social Care**

**Renewed emphasis on the importance of strong multi-agency partnerships:** accountability for local safeguarding arrangements, set within a new national framework, to sit equally between **LAs, Health, Police**. Local CSBs destined to be retired

**New lines of accountability within Schools:** aimed at ensuring excellent outcomes for Looked After Children by strenghtening measures for those adopted from State Care. To be prioritised, through capacity-building of designated staff who take responsibility for statutory guidance;

**New regulatory body for SW:** Social Work England

**Compulsory SRE for schools:**, agreed in **partnership with parent-carers** with a fresh focus on Relationships Education

**"Local Offer"** to be extended to **Care Leavers**

**The DfE have previously highlited three priority themes - in their words:** People and Leadership, Practice and Systems, Governance and Accountability as the strategic framework for the intended outcomes of the Act. 

**So where are we now?**

Well, commencement has been slightly more tricky to pin down, the Government being as distracted as it is, by the need for a coalition partner and by Brexit. 

But an Act it is, nonetheless. 

The onward march towards **whole-system** adoption of **sector-led improvement** models, **practice-led innovation**, **co-production** and **collaborative commissioning** (crossing practice, policy and geographical boundaries) 

....is not going anywhere, anytime soon!

I remain as conformable in my ‘implementation’ skin, as I am in my strategic and policy shoes. So if you have a complex mix of stakeholders, organisational partnerships and cross-sector boundaries to navigate, give me a call. Always happy to explore new ways of working.
