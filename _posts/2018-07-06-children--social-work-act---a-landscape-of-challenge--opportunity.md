July 2016 seems a very long time ago, not forgetting we have since then had a change of Prime Minister and the fall out from Brexit. But this is when **"Putting Children First"**&nbsp; - the Government's policy paper on Vulnerable Children - was first published. It reached the end of its Parliamentary journey pretty swiftly and was granted Royal Assent in April 2017, becoming the Children & Social Work Act. <!--base32-c9gq6t9k68pp8vkhe4u78e1dc9gq6t9k68-base32-->

It was always the intention of the Policy paper, that the Act would bring new statutory imperatives at whole-sector level to the agencies responsible for vulnerable children, impacting strategic priorities, inter-agency working, ownership and accountability. Those agencies could be forgiven, along with their wider ecosystem of public sector partners, for feeling that commencement and the green shoots of implementation, seemed strangely dislocated from the passing of the Act.&nbsp;

Some strands were quick to kick in - the adoption by Local Authorities of the requirement for whole-organisation Corporate Parenting Principles to name one. Others, such as the shift in ownership of who exactly is accountable for what in Schools, including Academy Trusts, has been slower to seed.

What is clear however, is that the Act would seek to consolidate structural shifts in the Public Sector, in the way money flows through the agency infrastructure, which have been gathering pace and quietly bedding in for at least the past 5 years. The Education & Adoption Act (2015) - with its focus on subregional 'cluster - working' by Local Authorities - passed by the attentions of many out in the field, yet was a clear signal of the ongoing 'direction of travel' by the Government to extend the thinking behind Devolution Deals, to everything else. Then there has been the rise of 'sector-led improvement' models, which the Schools sector has been grappling with for some time, but which the 2016 'Putting Children First' paper gave as an intended plank in the reform of the Social Work sector.

Then there is 'Co Production'

**Regional and sub-regional commissioning of services:** a need for collaborative working across traditional Public Sector geographical boundaries

**A mixed economy of providers:** including increased collaboration in service delivery with Charities

**'Sector - led' models of organisational improvement:** predicated on ‘peer to peer’ support and taking learning from the Education Sector

**Adoption of ‘Corporate Parenting Principles’:** to govern a whole – organisation approach at Local Authority level to promoting the interests of vulnerable children, with its key agency partners in **Education, Health, Social Care**

**Renewed emphasis on the importance of strong multi-agency partnerships:** accountability for local safeguarding arrangements, set within a new national framework, to sit equally between **LAs, Health, Police**. Local CSBs destined to be retired

**New lines of accountability within Schools:** aimed at ensuring excellent outcomes for Looked After Children by strenghtening measures for those adopted from State Care. To be prioritised, through capacity-building of designated staff who take responsibility for statutory guidance;

**New regulatory body for SW:** Social Work England

**Compulsory SRE for schools:**, agreed in **partnership with parent-carers** with a fresh focus on Relationships Education

**"Local Offer"** to be extended to **Care Leavers**

&nbsp;

**So where are we now?**

Well, commencement has been slightly more tricky to pin down, the Government being as distracted as it is, by the need for a coalition partner and by Brexit.

But an Act it is, nonetheless.

The onward march towards **whole-system** adoption of **sector-led improvement** models, **practice-led innovation**, **co-production** and **collaborative commissioning** (crossing practice, policy and geographical boundaries)

….is not going anywhere, anytime soon!

I remain as conformable in my ‘implementation’ skin, as I am in my strategic and policy shoes. So if you have a complex mix of stakeholders, organisational partnerships and cross-sector boundaries to navigate, give me a call. Always happy to explore new ways of working.
