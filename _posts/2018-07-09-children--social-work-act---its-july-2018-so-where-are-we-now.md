When **"Putting Children First"**&nbsp; - the Government's **policy paper on Vulnerable Children** - was first published in July 2016, implementation seemed a long way off. But it reached the end of its Parliamentary journey pretty swiftly and was granted Royal Assent in April 2017, becoming the Children & Social Work Act. <!--base32-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-base32-->

It was always the intention of the Policy paper, that the Act would bring new statutory imperatives at whole-sector level, to the agencies responsible for vulnerable children. Thus impacting **strategic priorities**, **inter-agency** working, **ownership** and **accountability**. However, those agencies could be forgiven, along with their wider ecosystem of public sector partners, for feeling that 'commencement' of the Act and the green shoots of implementation, seemed strangely dislocated from the passing of the Act.&nbsp;

Some strands were quick to kick in - the adoption by Local Authorities of the requirement for whole-organisation **Corporate Parenting Principles** to name one. Others, such as the shift in ownership of who exactly is accountable for what in **Schools**, including Academy Trusts, has been slower to seed.

What was clear to me however from the outset, is that the Act would seek to consolidate **structural shifts** in the **Public Sector -**&nbsp;the way money flows through the agency infrastructure - which has been gathering pace and quietly bedding in for at least the past 5 years.

The **Education & Adoption Act** (2015) - with its focus on sub regional 'cluster - working' by Local Authorities - passed by the attentions of many out in the field, yet was a clear signal of the ongoing 'direction of travel' by the Government to extend the thinking behind the preceding **Devolution Deals**, to everything else.

Then there has been the rise of '***sector-led improvement***' models, which the Schools sector has been grappling with for some time. The 2016 'Putting Children First' paper then gave expression to this, as a clearly signalled plank in the Act's reform of the Social Work sector - &nbsp;including who is seen to 'thought-lead' and who is in its organic '**community of practice**'.

And then there is '***Co Production***' - and &nbsp; the brave new world of the **Children & Families Act** (2014). For those with SEND, this should pivot on collaborative, person-centred decision-making between agencies, their representatives in the field, the child and their family. In itself, Co Production is not a funding mechanism but certainly, it was meant to be a strong influence on what money comes out of Government, where it goes and what it is used for to support SEND.

At the time of writing, this week brings an announcement by **[NCB](https://www.ncb.org.uk/news-opinion/news-highlights/ncb-lead-development-new-approaches-safeguarding)** and **[DfE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2)** of a national pilot, to be tested in the regions, of the long awaited re-structure of local Safeguarding agency arrangements.This move was clearly outlined in Putting Children First and set out in the Act. So implementation should not come as a surprise:&nbsp;**Local Children's Safeguarding Boards**&nbsp;are to be 'retired'. Fresh statutory impetus will fall on the a single 'multi-agency' effort of **Police**, **LAs** & **Health**.

So, new **multi-agency agreements, will be key**.

But more than that, **collaborative working, will be paramount** in pulling off effectiveness.

**So where does all this leave us at the present time with respect to delivery on the Act?&nbsp;**

**I have re-produced here, an analysis I first published on my (old) website, back in December 2016** after "Putting Children First" rolled off the press. This draws a picture of the '**sector shifts**' that we are all in the midst of, consciously, or otherwise.

Some points are specific parts of the Act, some are my own expression of the 'sector levers' which I see as at play in shaping the flow of money, decision- making and influence through the wider public sector 'economy'. &nbsp;

**A summary could be expressed thus: there will be (or more of) -**

**Regional and sub-regional commissioning of services:** a need for collaborative working across traditional Public Sector geographical boundaries

**A mixed economy of providers:** including increased collaboration in service delivery with Charities

**'Sector - led' models of organisational improvement:** predicated on ‘peer to peer’ support and taking learning from the Education Sector

**Adoption of ‘Corporate Parenting Principles’:** to govern a whole – organisation approach at Local Authority level to promoting the interests of vulnerable children, with its key agency partners in **Education, Health, Social Care**

**Renewed emphasis on the importance of strong multi-agency partnerships:** accountability for local safeguarding arrangements, set within a new national framework, to sit equally between **LAs, Health, Police**. Local CSBs destined to be retired

**New lines of accountability within Schools:** aimed at ensuring excellent outcomes for Children Looked After by strengthening measures for those adopted from State Care. To be prioritised, through capacity-building of designated staff who take responsibility for statutory guidance. Accountability rests with the Proprietors (including of Academies) not purely Governing Bodies&nbsp;

**New regulatory body for SW:** Social Work England

**Compulsory SRE for schools:**, agreed in **partnership with parent-carers** with a fresh focus on Relationships Education

**"Local Offer"** to be extended to **Care Leavers**

**So where are we now?**

Whilst commencement of all the strands of the Act, has been more of a trickle than a torrent, the changes it legislated for, are with us nonetheless.

It is worth remembering too that **rushed, large-scale implementation is rarely successful**, on the ground. That makes '**piloting**' as an approach, very sensible.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the onward march towards **whole-system** adoption of **sector-led improvement** models, **practice-led** innovation, **co-production** and **collaborative commissioning**&nbsp; - crossing **practice, policy** and **geographical** boundaries as it goes- &nbsp;is not going anywhere, anytime soon.

**Strap in & enjoy the ride.**
