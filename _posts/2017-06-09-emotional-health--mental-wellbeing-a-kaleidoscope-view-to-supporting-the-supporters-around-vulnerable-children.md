Back in the now dim & distant past of 2015, new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of **Mental Health** provision in supporting **Looked After Children**, was published by **Government**.

Its arrival was marked by an excellent event hosted by ***NCB***. Contributors from ***DfE*** and ***DoH ***came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of **Adoption,** and all three sectors of **Health, Education and Social Care**.<!--base32-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-base32-->

However, there was little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables (and I was sat next to an extremely lovely gentleman from OFSTED) or anything on the formal Agenda, on support that may be needed, available or could be developed, to support the **Wellbeing** of adults directly supporting&nbsp;**vulnerable children.**

No-one tabled the question : ***how do adults process the emotional impact of their work***, ***on themselves, and those around them?&nbsp;***&nbsp;In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds with the realities so many adults face, in the course of our daily task.

For those forming a **team around a child**, either at **work** or at **home**, many fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role, which is focussed on their own wellbeing, rather than discharge of their statutory duties or development of their Practice.<br>

What was discussed was entirely inequitable in its accessibility to all those adults who wold typically form a **Team around a Child**:

**Social Workers** and **Clinicians** attending that day were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including ***'Supervision'***. By and large, **Education** professionals were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.

**Foster Carers** were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through **Local Authority generated support**; **Adoptive** Parents felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.

Then there were **Parent-Carers**: this turned up a **zero**. There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers, despite many P-Cs of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently. Those parents of young people with **SEN, Disability** and enduring **Health** needs, typically have to pitch up to a&nbsp;**publically-funded statutory agency** setting, numerous times a year.

Truth to be told, there were not many P-Cs at the event. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance…. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined, me being part Policy- nerd, part human.&nbsp; I was there in a professional capacity, having recently stepped back into the workplace after a hugely extended stint on maternity leave.

But in families, whose children lived at home and are indeed highly Vulnerable, what happens to their mental state when the **adults** find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** of both child's emotional state at home**,**&nbsp;and, the **'services' battlegrounds**?

It's a challenge.

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware of the toll it takes those adults (any adult) supporting vulnerable children directly.

The toll it takes on a vulnerable child, trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, whilst plotting a course through their own emotional turmoil, is immense, regardless of outcomes and how well those adults do their jobs. It just is.

And if it is **immense for the child**, it's going to be **immense for the adult. **

The vast majority of parents, whether Corporate or not, want to meet that challenge in full, with gusto, with dedication and as an agent for that child's life ambitions.

It struck me so much that day and since, that we lack an system which helps adults process their work emotionally, which is **equitable** in access, and **evidence-based. **

**There are providers out there, for sure, doing fantastic work with Professionals&nbsp;**(MBO in Oxfordshire and the Anna Freud Centre in London to name but two). But nothing which the system recognises, truely looks at and responds to, the daily reality of who does what. There is no rounded, 360 package of training & support, to keep *each* of the individuals in the child's Team, healthy, objective and able to continue their role to an excellent standard.

**Parent-Carers have no access to a concrete support structure** for their own emotional wellbeing or **Practice Development,** which has parity with the Professionals in a Team, and certainly nothing&nbsp;**borne of an evidence-base.**

Yet, the additional challenges they face, operating as both the **child's advocate** with agencies, and the **child's relational backstop**, at home, are immense.

\*\*There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee. \*\*

**Friends** are good (especially those that are treading a similar path) but there are limits to what we can do for each other. And before anyone mentions an App, please don't. **Buttons are not support**, at least not for those of us borne in the late 1960s…..

And we do get asked alot, to consult on someone else's corporate plan: - not that parent-carers mind this-&nbsp; but when it's the only mode of interaction with public agencies and their arms-length partners, being repeatedly asked minus any actual support, can get a little wearing.&nbsp;

For many parent-carers, there is a need to **process the emotions** that come up when:

you feel **de-skilled** around your child (parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given to support an aspect of their child's development);

or **disempowered** in an agency meeting (this happens quite alot when professionals are discussing what they will and won't give your child); &nbsp;

or to handle that **strange, semi- disabling outbreak of 'over-empathy'** - the sort that seeps into your brain when you leave a conversation with **over-worked**, **under-resourced** public sector **professionals** who have just forgotten to implement a key part of your child's support plan for the third time that month…… but you've got to rollock them anyway.

There is of course, a smattering of (valued) opportunities from the third sector for P-Cs in their localities (often involving taking their child to an event which can be challenging in itself); there is also on-line access to guidance (again valued) on which to call to help P-Cs fight their children's cases with the pubic sector itself.

And, at the risk of doing a **dizzying 360**,&nbsp; one must not forget that **Public Sector Leaders** must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That comes with an **emotional cost**, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets. No-one goes into those jobs because they enjoy saying 'no' to families.

I think I should ad that NCB,&nbsp; as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation most definitely banging the drum of **Co Production** elsewhere with parent-carers. So no criticism implied there. The jury is still out on some of the other agencies attending that day.

So, I have begun a **journey of 'curious enquiry'** with a range of **organisations**, sector -level **stakeholder** groups and with **individuals**, with who I am fortunate to have regular contact.

A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building, of professional, stakeholder and personal **perspectives** over the past decade.

It's a **kaleidoscope view**. One which I aim to deploy for the greater good, wherever possible and practicable.

There is (still) a debate to be had nationally, about how to resource and systematize the maintaining of ALL adults in a team around a child so that they remain **healthy**, **objective** and able to stay the course, without frazzling away into oblivion.

A **national offer,**&nbsp;which sits outside of Child Protection, needs to be **systemised** across all the sectors involved (Health, Education & Social Care). Its about the professional-level skills regardless of job title.

Early Help Offers from Local Authorities can be variable but by and large, parents of Young People with SEND, find these off putting because the entire process sits in a Safeguarding frame, and is discharged by professionals used to driving assessment through the lens of Child Protection.&nbsp; The Professionals in a Team around the Child, do not have to make recourse to anything of this nature which feels so compromising, in order to stay on task, healthy and objective after a Team Meeting.&nbsp;

A national offer is needed which is&nbsp;**equitable** in its access (and include Teachers' Wellbeing), not be workplace or seniority dependant, and crucially, recognise the **Parent-Carer** as part of that team.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector, as well as with Parent-Carers, to raise awareness of this issue and seek to trigger a **systems-level** intervention.
