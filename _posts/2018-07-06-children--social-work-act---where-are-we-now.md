July 2016 seems a very long time ago, not forgetting we have since then had a change of Prime Minister and the fall out from Brexit. But this is when **"Putting Children First"**&nbsp; - the Government's policy paper on Vulnerable Children - was first published. It reached the end of its Parliamentary journey pretty swiftly and was granted Royal Assent in April 2017, becoming the Children & Social Work Act. <!--base32-c9gq6t9k68pp6eb7e4v78ebb6rw70w1retnpgt9memvkgt9hchhkjtvh6tu3jutp70pp4rbkcmtk4-base32-->

It was always the intention of the Policy paper, that the Act would bring new statutory imperatives at whole-sector level to the agencies responsible for vulnerable children, impacting **strategic priorities**, **inter-agency** working, **ownership** and **accountability**. Those agencies could be forgiven, along with their wider ecosystem of public sector partners, for feeling that commencement and the green shoots of implementation, seemed strangely dislocated from the passing of the Act.&nbsp;

Some strands were quick to kick in - the adoption by Local Authorities of the requirement for whole-organisation **Corporate Parenting Principles** to name one. Others, such as the shift in ownership of who exactly is accountable for what in **Schools**, including Academy Trusts, has been slower to seed.

What is clear however, is that the Act would seek to consolidate **structural shifts** in the **Public Sector**, in the way money flows through the agency infrastructure, which have been gathering pace and quietly bedding in for at least the past 5 years. The **Education & Adoption Act** (2015) - with its focus on subregional 'cluster - working' by Local Authorities - passed by the attentions of many out in the field, yet was a clear signal of the ongoing 'direction of travel' by the Government to extend the thinking behind the preceding **Devolution Deals**, to everything else. Then there has been the rise of '***sector-led improvement***' models, which the Schools sector has been grappling with for some time. The 2016 'Putting Children First' paper then gave expression to this as an intended plank in the Act's reform of the Social Work sector, who thought-leads and its 'community of practice'.

And what of '***Co Production***'? A tenet of the brave new world ushered in by the **Children & Families Act** (2014) for those with SEND, which pivots on collaborative, person-centered decision-making between agencies, their representatives in the field and families. In itself, not a funding mechanism but certainly, a influencer in what money comes out of Government, where it goes and what it is purported to be used for.

This saw the announcement by **[NCB](https://www.ncb.org.uk/news-opinion/news-highlights/ncb-lead-development-new-approaches-safeguarding)** and **[DfE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2)** of a national pilot, to be tested in the regions, of the long awaited re-structure of local Safeguarding arrangements outlined in the C&SW Act. **Local Children's Safeguarding Boards**&nbsp;are to be 'retired'. Fresh statutory impetus will fall on the a single 'multi-agency' effort of **Police**, **LAs** & **Health**.

So new multi-agency agreements, will be key. But more than that, collaborative working, will be paramount in pulling this off.

**So where does all this leave us at the present time? **

I have re-produced below here, an analysis I first published here back in December 2016 after "Putting Children First" rolled off the press. This draws a picture of the 'sector shifts' that we are all in the midst of, knowingly or otherwise.

Some points are specific parts of the Act, some are my own expression of the 'sector levers' which are now at play in shaping the flow of money through the wider public sector economy:

**Regional and sub-regional commissioning of services:** a need for collaborative working across traditional Public Sector geographical boundaries

**A mixed economy of providers:** including increased collaboration in service delivery with Charities

**'Sector - led' models of organisational improvement:** predicated on ‘peer to peer’ support and taking learning from the Education Sector

**Adoption of ‘Corporate Parenting Principles’:** to govern a whole – organisation approach at Local Authority level to promoting the interests of vulnerable children, with its key agency partners in **Education, Health, Social Care**

**Renewed emphasis on the importance of strong multi-agency partnerships:** accountability for local safeguarding arrangements, set within a new national framework, to sit equally between **LAs, Health, Police**. Local CSBs destined to be retired

**New lines of accountability within Schools:** aimed at ensuring excellent outcomes for Children Looked After by strengthening measures for those adopted from State Care. To be prioritised, through capacity-building of designated staff who take responsibility for statutory guidance. Accountability rests with the Proprietors (including of Academies) not purely Governing Bodies&nbsp;

**New regulatory body for SW:** Social Work England

**Compulsory SRE for schools:**, agreed in **partnership with parent-carers** with a fresh focus on Relationships Education

**"Local Offer"** to be extended to **Care Leavers**

So where are we now?

Well, whilst commencement of all the strands of the Act, has been perhaps more of a trickle than a torrent, the changes it legislated for, are with us nonetheless.

It is worth remembering too that rushed, large-scale implementation is rarely successful, on the ground. That makes 'piloting' as an approach, very sensible.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the onward march towards **whole-system** adoption of **sector-led improvement** models, **practice-led innovation**, **co-production** and **collaborative commissioning**&nbsp; - which crosses practice, policy and geographical boundaries- &nbsp;is not going anywhere, anytime soon.

**Strap in & enjoy the ride.**
