Back in the now seemingly dim & distant 2015, new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government.

Its arrival was marked by an excellent event hosted by NCB. Contributors from DfE and DoH came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, Health, Education and Social Care.<!--base32-dnqq4t8-base32-->

As I reflected back on the event, both at the time and now, there was little or no discussion that day amongst delegates, on what support was needed, available or could be developed to support the Wellbeing of adults - those delivering support direct to vulnerable children.

None really asked - how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?&nbsp;

In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds with the realities we must all surely face, in the course of our daily task.

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many seemed entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which was focussed on their own wellbeing and which was evidence-based in its approach.

There was also nothing that was equitable to access.

Social Workers and Clinicians were familiar with existing structures in the workplace, including 'Supervision'. By and large, Education professionals were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.

Foster Carers were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; Adoptive Parents felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.

Then there were Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero. There is no 'workplace' scheme for parent-carers even though many are operating in fact, in the 'workplace'. Usually other people's workplaces. Frequently, in a publically-funded statutory agency setting.&nbsp;

Truth to be told, there were not many P-Cs at the event (not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance) and elsewhere, NCB are an organisation banging the drum of Co Production.

But in those families, whose children lived at home and are indeed highly Vulnerable, what happens when they find themselves unwittingly at the front line of both child's emotional state and, the 'services' battlegrounds?

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware of the toll it takes those adults supporting vulnerable children directly. Mainly because the toll it takes on a vulnerable child trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, whilst plotting a course through their own emotional turmoil, is immense.

And if it is immense for the child, it's going to be immense for the adult.T

Parent-Carers have no access to a concrete support structure which extended beyond informal cups of coffee, a smattering of opportunities from the third sector in their localities (which largely involved taking their children to events) and the availability of on-line guidance to help fight their children's cases with the pubic sector.

The advent of Carer Assessments has not hugely altered this.

So I have begun a journey of 'curious enquiry' with a range of organisations, sector -level stakeholder groups and individuals, with who I am fortunate to have regular contact.&nbsp; A sort of 3 - way lens built of professional, stakeholder and personal perspectives has steadily but surely developed over the past decade. A kaleidoscope view and to find a path through their inner emotional turmoil, to the outside world,of those engaged ever day in this task. &nbsp;The response, was largely unanomous. That it is both a need Foster carers may access professional level support more readily, but what of Adoptive Parents? Then there is the army of so-called 'ordinary' parents who find themselves meeting mental health needs at home…

Public Sector management professionals too, must take difficult decisions that come with an emotional cost.

Many of us will have come into contact with a dedicated but frazzled member of schools staff: - busy teaching verbs one minute, discussing a traumatic Child Protection case the next.

Parent-carers too, of vulnerable children including those with Mental Health challenges sometimes never catch a break. Wherever their child is, you can be sure that child will process everything they experience through their nearest and dearest once home…..

If you are a professional from the clinical or therapeutic world, you may well have access to Supervision as part and parcel of your working infrastructure.

But what if you don't?

Friends, peers and close colleagues may help enormously. But it is questionable if that is able to do the job as effectively long term, as proper professional support.

There is a debate to be had nationally, about recognising this need for ALL the adults in the support circle around a child or young person to access support, how that is systemised across all the sectors involved and how it is resourced.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector to garner **'support for the supporters'**.

I pop up and annoy folk with my chivvying on a regular basis!
