Back in the now seemingly dim & distant 2015, new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government.

Its arrival was marked by an excellent event hosted by NCB. Contributors from DfE and DoH came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, Health, Education and Social Care.<!--base32-c9gq6t9k68pp6eb7e4v78ebb6rw70w1retnpgt9memvkgt9hchhkjtvh6tu3jutp70pp4rbkcmtk4-base32-->

As I reflected back on the event, both at the time and now, there was little or no discussion that day amongst delegates on what support was needed, available or could be developed to support the Wellbeing of adults - those delivering support direct to vulnerable children.

No-one really asked that day - how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?&nbsp;

In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds with the realities we must all surely face, in the course of our daily task.

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many seemed entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which was focussed on their own wellbeing and which was evidence-based in its approach.

There was too, a lack of anything, remotely equitable to access.

Social Workers and Clinicians were familiar with some existing structures in the workplace, including 'Supervision'. By and large, Education professionals were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.

Foster Carers were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; Adoptive Parents felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.

Then there were Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero. There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers. However, many P-Cs are operating in the 'workplace'. Other people's workplaces. Frequently, persistently and over a long period of time, usually in a publically-funded statutory agency setting.&nbsp;

Truth to be told, there were not many P-Cs at the event. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidanceâ€¦. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined!&nbsp; I was there in a professional capacity, having recently stepped back into the workplace after a hugely extended stint on maternity leave.

But in families, whose children lived at home and are indeed highly Vulnerable - what happens when the adults find themselves unwittingly at the front line of both child's emotional state, and, the 'services' battlegrounds?

It's a challenge of endurance.

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware of the toll it takes those adults - any adult- supporting vulnerable children directly. The toll it takes on a vulnerable child trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, whilst plotting a course through their own emotional turmoil, is immense. It just is.

And if it is immense for the child, it's going to be immense for the adult.

Parent-Carers have no access to a concrete support structure for their own emotional wellbeing, which is equitable to access, and borne of an evidence-base. There is nothing that recognises the additional challenges they face as both the child's advocate with agencies, and the child's confidante at home.

There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee and is not about consulting on someone else's agency plans.&nbsp;

Friends are good (especially those that are treading a similar path) but there are limits to what we can do for each other. And before anyone mentions an App, please don't. Perhaps I am showing my age.

For many parent-carers, there is a need to process the emotions that come up when you feel de-skilled around your child (parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies to deal with something or other at home); or disempowered in an agency meeting (this happens quite alot when professionals are discussing what they will and won't give your child); &nbsp;or experiencing that strange outbreak of over-empathy with professionals - the sort that seeps into your brain when you leave a meeting with over-worked, under-resourced public sector staff who have just forgotten to implement a key part of your child's support plan...... but you've got to rollock them anyway.

I think I should ad that NCB&nbsp; as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation most definitely banging the drum of Co Production and Consultation elsewhere with parent-carers. The jury is out on some of the others.

There is of course a smattering of (valued) opportunities from the third sector for P-Cs (which frequently involves them taking their children to events); and (again valued) on-line access to guidance which can help fight their children's cases with the pubic sector itself.

At the risk of doing a dizzying 360,&nbsp; one must not forget that Public Sector management professionals, must take very difficult decisions about service reform transformation. That comes with an emotional cost.

So I have begun a journey of 'curious enquiry' with a range of organisations, sector -level stakeholder groups and individuals, with who I am fortunate to have regular contact.&nbsp;

A sort of 3 - way lens has been slowly but surely building, of professional, stakeholder and personal perspectives over the past decade.

A kaleidoscope.

There is still a debate to be had nationally, about how to keep adults in a team around a child healthy, objective and able to stay the course without frazzling away into oblivion.

An offer needs to be systemised across all the sectors involved (Health, Education & Social Care) be equitable in its access, not be workplace dependant and crucially, recognise the Parent-Carer as part of that team.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector to raise awareness of this issue and trigger a systems-level intervention. If you would like to join me in&nbsp;**'support for the supporters'** get in touch.&nbsp;
