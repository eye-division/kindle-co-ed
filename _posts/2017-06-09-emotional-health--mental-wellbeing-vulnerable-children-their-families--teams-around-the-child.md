New statutory guidance, emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published back in March 2015. Marked by an excellent event hosted by NCB, contributors from DfE and DoH came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, Health, Education and Social Care.<!--more-->

But as we reflect on this, what support is there for the Wellbeing of those adults delivering this kind of support to children? How do they process the emotional impact of their work on themselves and those around them?

Foster carers may access professional level support more readily, but what of Adoptive Parents? Then there is the army of so-called 'ordinary' parents who find themselves meeting mental health needs at home…

Public Sector management professionals too, must take difficult decisions that come with an emotional cost.

Many of us will have come into contact with a dedicated but frazzled member of schools staff: - busy teaching verbs one minute,  discussing a traumatic Child Protection case the next.

Parent-carers too, of vulnerable children including those with Mental Health challenges sometimes never catch a break. Wherever their child is, you can be sure that child will process everything they experience through their nearest and dearest once home…..

If you are a professional from the clinical or therapeutic world, you may well have access to Supervision as part and parcel of your working infrastructure.

But what if you don't?

Friends, peers and close colleagues may help enormously. But it is questionable if that is able to do the job as effectively long term, as proper professional support.

There is a debate to be had nationally, about recognising this need for ALL the adults in the support circle around a child or young person to access support, how that is systemised across all the sectors involved and how it is resourced.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector to garner **'support for the supporters'**.

I pop up and annoy folk with my chivvying on a regular basis!
