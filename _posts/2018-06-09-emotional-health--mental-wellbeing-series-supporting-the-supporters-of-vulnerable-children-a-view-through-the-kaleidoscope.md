Back in the now **dim & distant past of 2015**, new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government.

Its arrival was marked by **an excellent event hosted by** [**NCB**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/). Contributors from **DfE** and **DoH** came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, and from the 'big three' of&nbsp;**Health**, **Education** and **Social Care**.

However, there was nothing substantial on the formal Agenda,&nbsp; and little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables (I was sat next to an extremely lovely gentleman from OFSTED) on the support that may be needed for adults directly working with these vulnerable children.

> **No-one tabled the question:** *how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?***In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds** with the realities so many adults face, in the course of our daily task.

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role, which is focused on their own wellbeing. There is a lack of support which is**&nbsp;systematised, and rooted in evidence-based practice, to help all the adults involved,** at least not a system which is restricted to those carrying out the role of Foster or Corporate Parent.

What support there is, tends to be **lopsided in who can access it**, and is either about **practice-development** when delivering with the child, about the **mechanics of discharging statutory duties**, or **arms-length counselling** for individuals, through services which are fundamentally **disconnected to the Team**.

Social Workers and Clinicians attending that day back in 2015, were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including '***Supervision***'. By and large, Education professionals were not. A supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.

**Foster Carers** were more likely to be viewed as Professionals and could access training through Local Authority generated support; **Adoptive Parents** felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.

What was discussed was entirely inequitable in its accessibility to all those adults who would typically form a **Team around a Child**.

> ***Then there were Parent-Carers: this turned up a zero.***
>
>
> There is **no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers,** despite many P-Cs of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently. Those are the parents of young people with **SEN**, **Disabilities** and with enduring **Health** needs, who typically have to pitch up to a publically-funded statutory agency setting, numerous times a year.

**Truth to be told, there were not many P-Cs at the event**. Not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance…. it can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined. I'm part Policy- nerd, part human, so thoroughly enjoyed myself in a professional capacity, having recently stepped back into the workplace, after a hugely extended stint on maternity leave.

But in families, whose **children are not Looked After by the state, live at home** and are indeed **highly Vulnerable**, what happens to the **mental state of the adults,** when they find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** of both child's **emotional needs** at home, and, the '**services**' negotiating grounds?

Most parent-carers, given a suitably 'safe - (**non-judgmental, non-pathologizing**)- space', would say, it's a massive challenge.

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware of the toll it takes those adults - any adult - supporting vulnerable children directly.

The toll it takes on a vulnerable child, trying to live & learn in our schools and in our communities, whilst plotting a course through their own emotional turmoil, is immense, regardless of eventual outcomes and, how well those adults do their jobs.&nbsp;

> **And if it is immense for the child, it's going to be immense for the adult.**

The vast majority of parents, whether Corporate or not, want to meet these challenges in full, selflessly, with gusto & dedication and be an effective agent for that child's own life ambitions.

It struck me so much that day and since, that we lack an system which helps adults process their work emotionally, which is equitable in access, and evidence-based.

There are providers out there, doing some fantastic work with Professionals and with Families in a very holistic way (***MBO in Oxfordshire*** and the ***Anna Freud Centre \*\**in London to name but two). But \*\*nothing which our national systems supports**, which truly responds to the daily reality of who does what, in a Team around a Child when they are **unwell, and not thriving** socially and educationally.

*\*\*There is no rounded, 360 package of training & support, to help keep each of the individuals in the child's Team, \*\**healthy, objective and able to continue their role to an excellent standard.

> **Parent-Carers** have no routine access to a concrete support structure for their own emotional wellbeing or Practice Development, which has **parity with the Professionals** in a Team, and certainly **nothing borne of an evidence-base.**

Yet, the additional challenges they face, operating as both the child's advocate with agencies, and the child's relational backstop, at home, are immense.

Friends are good (especially those that are treading a similar path) but there are limits to what we can do for each other. And before anyone mentions an App, please don't. Buttons are not support, whatever the lure of the global marketplace may be.

> ***There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee.&nbsp;***

**Parent-Carers do get asked alot, to consult on other people's corporate plans**: - not that parent-carers mind this-&nbsp; but when it's the only mode of interaction with public agencies and their arms-length partners, being repeatedly asked minus any actual support, can get a little wearing.&nbsp;

**For many parent-carers, there is a need to process the emotions that come up when:**

* you feel **de-skilled** around your child (parents are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given to support an aspect of their child's development);
* or **disempowered** in an agency meeting (this happens quite alot when professionals are discussing what they will and won't give your child); &nbsp;
* or to handle that strange, ***semi- disabling outbreak of 'over-empathy***' …… you know the sort that seeps into your brain when you leave a conversation with over-worked, **under-resourced public sector professionals** who have just forgotten to implement a key part of your child's support plan …… but you've got to tackle it head on with them anyway..?

There is of course, a smattering of (valued) opportunities from the third sector for P-Cs in their localities, often involving taking their child to an event which in itself, can be challenging. There is also on-line access to guidance (again valued) on which to call to help P-Cs advocate for their children's cases with the pubic sector.

At the risk of doing a dizzying 360,&nbsp; one must not forget that [**Public Sector Leaders**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/resources-publications/browse-our-publications-catalogue/putting-corporate-parenting-practice) must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That comes with an emotional cost, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets.

> No-one goes into [**Corporate Parenting** ](https://www.ncb.org.uk/resources-publications/browse-our-publications-catalogue/putting-corporate-parenting-practice)because they enjoy saying 'no' to families.

I think I should ad that NCB,&nbsp; as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation most definitely banging the drum of [**Co Production**](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/resources-and-help/im-parent) elsewhere with parent-carers. So no criticism implied of the 2015 event. The jury is still out on some of the other agencies driving that day.

So, I have begun *a journey of 'curious enquiry'* with a range of organisations, sector -level stakeholder groups and with individuals, with who I am fortunate to have regular contact.

A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building of professional, stakeholder and personal perspectives over the past decade.&nbsp;**It's a multi-faceted, colourful and sometimes overwhelming kaleidoscope view** but one which I committed to deploying for the greater good, wherever possible and practicable.

**There is a debate to be had nationally,** about how to resource and **systematize the maintaining of ALL adults in a team** **around a child** so that they remain healthy, objective and able to stay the course, without frazzling away into oblivion. Experts would refer to [**Psychodynamic Theory &** Relational]((https://mulberrybush.org.uk/the-work-of-mbs/#.WzISzdVKiM8))&nbsp;Practice.

But to many parents, this would simply be about 'team skills'&nbsp; and 'Mental Health'.&nbsp;

[**Projection** ](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Projection)is commonplace in meetings between adults, as well as when the child is in the room. Learning **who's feelings belong to whom**, and why, is something I have learned is incredibly important when trying to get things done, personally and professionally. Deployed consciously and wisely, this can be helpful in **brokering agreements, garnering stakeholder buy-in and ultimately facilitate the reaching of positive outcomes.**&nbsp;

**Left unchecked** and unprocessed, such feelings whether brought up when contributing as a professional, or as a parent, around the table, can be&nbsp;**a route to ill health for the adult**, and ultimately poorer outcomes for the child.

**For parents of those with SEND, Local Authority *Early Help***&nbsp;'offers' seem extremely variable. Parent-carers can find these very off -putting because the entire process sits in a Safeguarding frame. Engagement is frequently led by professionals used to driving any 'assessment' of Help, through the lens of Child Protection.&nbsp; Google a few randomly selected examples on 'Early Help' for families and you will find some LAs are much more welcoming in their tone, than others.

A **national offer is needed which is equitable in its access** (and includes Parent's and Teachers' Wellbeing, alongside Clinicians & Social Workers), is not workplace or seniority -specific and is able to sit&nbsp;**outside of Child Protection.** It's about supporting the professional-level practice skills and emotional load, demanded of all Team members around a child, regardless of their 'job' title.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services and the Public Sector, as well as with Parent-Carers, to raise awareness of this issue and seek to trigger a **systems-level intervention**.
