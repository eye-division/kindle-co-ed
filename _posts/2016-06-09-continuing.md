##KINDLECO: CONTINUING TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENTS AT INNOVATIVE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S CHARITY

>“As a national charity at the cutting edge of support for vulnerable children &amp; families, The Mulberry Bush Organisation has to evolve in response to government led change – and now is no exception", says John Diamond, CEO. 

>"My vision is to lead the organisation to a response that is strategic, well-informed and practical. Working with Jo Broad has enabled me to achieve that".

>Jo is able to demonstrate quickly her skills in capturing our organisational 'essence’, and sound understanding of our corporate dynamics. Combining this with strong analytical skills and an experienced grasp of public sector mechanics, Jo enables us to arrive at an informed view of what the key shifts in the wider Public Sector - Putting Children First, the Children &amp; Families Act, Health &amp; Wellbeing Boards, Future in Mind, Adoption Support - can mean for us as a whole-organisation. We will be meeting implementation with confidence.”
John Diamond, CEO, Mulberry Bush Organisation
