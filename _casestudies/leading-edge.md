## The People

Now nationally recognised as being at the forefront of school leadership, back in 2004 Andrew Hutchinson was Head of the then Parkside College (now part of United Learning the "Cambridge Academic Partnership") in Cambridge. He set out with a fresh vision to bring local schools into the Parkside fold. Determined to develop Parkside at the heart of the City's learning community, he brought together a two secondary schools and an international 6th form as a unique learning hub for the City. He pursued a vision to share both the benefits and challenges of serving his learning community through a single organisation structure. As an innovator, he also recognised the importance of schools developing a unique character, and deployed the Government’s Specialist Status programme to help achieve this.

## The Challenge

In support of the wider corporate vision, Andrew asked Jo to help achieve his objective to develop Parkside as a hub for enterprise & the Arts within the Specialist Status programme, by developing interest and partnerships with the external business community.

## My Response

Deploying KindleCo's core values, I set out to capture the interest of the City’s business community in service of the the School and its newly-developing status as a Learning Community outside the school's walls. Focusing on Parkside's commitment and sector Leadership through the government’s Specialist Status programme, I identified brokerage opportunities with external partners who could share the Parkside social & educational mission, and might invest in it.

## The Success

I was able to bring partnerships worth in excess of £35,000 to table. Nearly two decades on, Schools are now commonly adopting the multi-partner academy model trail blazed by Andrew at the former Parkside Federation. Andrew was awarded the OBE in December 2008 for services to Education.
