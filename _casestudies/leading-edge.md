## The People

Now nationally recognised as being at the forefront of school leadership, an innovative Executive Head Teacher set out with a fresh vision to bring local schools into the fold of a single schools organisational structure. Determined to develop the federated schools cluster at the heart of his City’s learning community, he brought together a two secondary schools and an international 6th form as a unique learning hub for the City, deploying the Government’s Specialist Status programme for schools to help achieve this, by giving the learning hub a distinctive character.

## The Challenge

In support of the wider corporate vision,  Jo was commissioned to help achieve the objective to develop the federation and its lead school as a hub for enterprise & the Arts within the Specialist Status programme, by developing partnership and investment opportunities with the external business community.

## My Response

Deploying KindleCo’s core values, I set out to capture the interest of the City’s business community in service of the the School and its newly-developing status as a Learning Community outside the school’s walls. I identified brokerage opportunities with external partners who could share the schools' social & educational mission, and invest in it.

## The Success

I was able to bring partnerships worth in excess of £35,000 to table. Schools now commonly adopting the multi-partner academy model trail blazed by this innovative Education leader, who was awarded the OBE for services to Education.
