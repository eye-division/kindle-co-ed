The People
---
Now nationally recognised as being at the forefront of school leadership, back in 2004 Andrew Hutchinson was Head of the then ‘Parkside College’ in Cambridge. He set out with a fresh vision to bring local schools into the Parkside fold. Determined to develop Parkside at the heart of the City's learning community, he brought together a two secondary schools and an international 6th form as a unique learning hub for the City.  He pursued a vision to share both the benefits and challenges of serving his learning community through a single organisation structure. As an innovator, he also recognised the importance of schools developing a unique character, and deployed the Government’s Specialist Status programme to help achieve this.

The Challenge
---
In support of the wider corporate vision, Andrew asked Jo to help achieve his objective to develop Parkside as a hub for enterprise & the creative industries within the Specialist Status programme, by developing interest and partnerships with the external business community.

Our Response 
---
KindleCo captured the interest of the City’s business community. Jo deployed Andrew’s commitment to the government’s Specialist Status programme to broker dialogue with external partners who could share the Parkside social & educational mission.

The Success
---
Jo brought partnerships worth in excess of £35,000 to table.
10 years on, Schools are now commonly adopting the single- organisation / multi-partner models trail blazed by Andrew Hutchinson at the Parkside Federation. Andrew was awarded the OBE in December 2008 for services to Education.
