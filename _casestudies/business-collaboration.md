The People
---
Competing businesses that deliver training for young people of 14-19 years.

The Challenge
---
To enable a network of individual public-sector funded organisations and privately owned businesses to work on collaborative projects and operate as a ‘single voice’ representing their market sector in support of young Apprenticeships.

Our Response 
---
Facilitated by Jo, the network was able to identify shared objectives. A 12 month action plan was produced and delivery of new projects initiated.

The Success
---
The outcomes of our work were delivery by the network of a shared marketing drive, a profile - raising conference in its own sector, promotion to parents, carers & young people of the training on offer and the commissioning of a bespoke staff development programme to improve individual business performance. Additional resources were levered into the network from government sources to support the work.
