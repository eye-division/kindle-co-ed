## The People

Immediately prior to establishing Kindle, Jo Broad was responsible for Learning & Skills at Arts Council England in the East England region. Jo brought together a range of partners including the East England Development Agency, Arts Council England, the Goverment's Skills for Life programme, BAA Stansted and two Learning & Skills Councils to collaborate on finding new ways to support young unemployed people into work.

## The Challenge

We set out to forge a link between the agendas of different government agencies and a major regional employer to enable collaborative action on regional workforce skills to further the employment prospects of young people.

## The Response

Jo brokered a partnership with BAA's Stansted Airport and a range of agencies supporting young people and adults. A joint objective was agreed of increasing recruitment and employment at the Airport of young people & young adults disadvantaged in the job market due to poor key skills. Jo brought together five diverse organisations and associated funding streams. The expertise & resources of different organisations were pooled and an innovative training tool using the Arts was established within the Airport Skills Programme. Using the Arts as a delivery mechanism, the training was fun for participants, had measurable learning outcomes and was bespoke to the employer.

## The Success

The BAA partnership project helped strengthen the ‘innovation’ branding of the Airport Skills Programme and was reported by BAA to have approximately 40 % improved success in recruiting young trainees to the point of job placement. The project provided an exchange of skills between mainstream and niche arts-based training providers.  The project was subsequently promoted by BAA Stansted to its sister airports at Heathrow and Gatwick.
