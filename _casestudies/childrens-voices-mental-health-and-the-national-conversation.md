### **Children's Voices, Mental Health and the national conversation**

**In 2017, I ventured my very first *LinkedIn* article to mark \#WMHD**

To those who know me well, I make no secret of finding social media, the attention economy and the age of 'self-promotion' incredibly uncomfortable. So, my great thanks to all those who read, liked, shared and gave me such valuable feedback on my article:

**MH was, and is still, riding high in the media like never before.** Campaigns to end stigma, raise awareness and promote resilience abound. Children & YP’s Mental Health is front of stage.

**But how, why and when do the attitudes to Mental Health, that our children later go on to adopt, really begin?** And do the campaign headlines mean the tide of ‘stigma’ is turning? I explore the position statement published by our then Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield
