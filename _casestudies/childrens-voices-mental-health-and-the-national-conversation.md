### **Children's Voices, Mental Health and the national conversation**

**I published my very first *LinkedIn* article to mark \#WMHD**

My great thanks to all those who read, liked, shared and gave me such valuable feedback

**MH was, and is still, riding high in the media like never before.** Campaigns to end stigma, raise awareness and promote resilience abound. Children & YP’s Mental Health is front of stage. These are all positives.

**But how, why and when do the attitudes to Mental Health, that our children later go on to adopt, really begin?** And do the campaign headlines mean the tide of ‘stigma’ is turning?

## The People

Competing businesses that deliver training for young people of 14-19 years.

## The Challenge

To enable a network of individual public-sector funded organisations and privately owned businesses to work on collaborative projects and operate as a ‘single voice’ representing their market sector in support of young Apprenticeships.

## My Response

Facilitated by me, the network was able to identify shared objectives. A 12 month action plan was produced and delivery of new projects initiated.

## The Success

The outcomes of our work together were delivery by the network of a shared marketing drive, a profile - raising conference in its own sector, promotion to parents, carers & young people of the training on offer and the commissioning of a bespoke staff development programme to improve individual business performance. Additional resources were levered into the network from government sources to support the work.
