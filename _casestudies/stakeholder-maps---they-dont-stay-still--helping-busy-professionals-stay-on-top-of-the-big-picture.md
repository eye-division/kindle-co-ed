> "Staying abreast of significant change in the complex eco-system of my multiple stakeholders, is fundamental to the success of my role….. KindleCo helps busy professionals working at the inter-section of innovation and public policy, to keep ontop of those ever-changing Stakeholder maps!

In the Health Outcomes business, I have to understand those Stakeholder needs as they evolve. The quick-fire briefing note produced by KindleCo brought me straight up to speed on recent ***changes at national level*** impacting the way Health would work with its partner agencies in support of Womens Health, Children & Young People… Accessible, bite-size & bespoke, the note was information-rich, when I was time poor".
