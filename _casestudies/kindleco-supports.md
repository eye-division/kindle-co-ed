  As a national charity at the cutting edge of support for vulnerable children &
  families, The Mulberry Bush Organisation recognised early-on that it needed to
  respond to government led change. Key shifts at national level, in the
  Children & Families Act, the arrival of Health & Wellbeing Boards, and the
  advent of Future in Mind, provide both challenge and opportunity to its
  charitable mission.

The People
---
Improving the life outcomes for traumatised and vulnerable children is the mission of the Mulberry Bush Organisation based in Oxfordshire. 

For those organisations who need and want to work in close partnership with the Public Sector, policy and system change at national level can heavily impact an organisation’s work, as well as that of their customers, partners and stakeholders. 

The potential to feel simultaneously corporately excited, overwhelmed and challenged, becomes a regular occurrence for many operating in the Public Sector eco-system. 

Jo has been working with MBO as a specialist Associate since September 2013 to help support MBO's response the changing national policy and strategic landscape, from the Children & Families Act 2014, to Health & Wellbeing, Putting Children First and more.

The Challenge
---
To assist senior leadership in achieving its objective, to lead the organisation to a response to the Children & Families Act, Health & Wellbeing, Putting Children First and other key shifts at national level impacting the sectors supporting vulnerable children & families. 

The response needed to be bespoke, support their charitable mission, further the corporate objectives for the whole-organisation, be strategic and be practical.

The Response
---
Formed an evidence-based analysis of specific opportunities and risks arising from external changes in sector; developed a strategy to embrace these as a whole-organisation; produced set of prioritised 'next-steps' for each  major change;  identified opportunities for business development, strategic partnerships and growing MBO’s sphere of influence; working in partnership with key organisational Leaders to achieve this.
