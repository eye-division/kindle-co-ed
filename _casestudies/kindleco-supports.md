  As a national charity at the cutting edge of support for vulnerable children &
  families, The Mulberry Bush Charity recognised early-on that it needed to
  respond to external change including Government-influenced shifts which
  trickle through the sector. Key shifts from the specifics of implementing the
  Children & Families Act 2014, to the more considered response of providing a
  Reflective Space for sector Leaders to "Think" together as they emerge from
  the global Pandemic of 2020: these all provide moments of both challenge &
  opportunity to its charitable mission.

## The People

Improving the educational and long term life outcomes for traumatised children, and&nbsp; all those affected by childhood trauma, is the mission of the Mulberry Bush Charity, based in Oxfordshire.

For those organisations who need, and want, to work in close partnership with the public policy and systems change at national level, the load can feel heavy. External shifts can impact heavily on an organisation’s work, as well as that of their customers, partners and stakeholders.

The potential to feel simultaneously corporately excited & overwhelmed becomes a regular occurrence for many operating in the complex eco-system of stakeholder networks and funding pools which flow from Government policy.

Jo has been working with MBO as a specialist Associate since September 2013 to help support the Charity's response the changing external landscape. From the very specific challenges of implementing the Children & Families Act 2014, to MB's shaping of a more nuanced and considered response to supporting its stakeholders' emergence from the 2020 Global Pandemic. Jo has contributed to SLT Policy Groups, Think Tanks and task & finish work with its CEO and other organisational Leaders addressing service development, for over 8 years.&nbsp;

## The Challenge

To partner senior leadership in achieving its objectives when leading the organisation in response to key external shifts for the organisation, the wider sector and its&nbsp; stakeholders.

## The Response

Formulation of evidence-based analyses of specific opportunities and risks, arising from external changes; contribution to strategy formation; identification of opportunities for business development, strategic partnerships and growing MBO’s sphere of influence in respect of public sector; generation of potential 'next-steps' route maps for major change; contributing to specific events and new developments such as its Post Pandemic peer 2 peer "Think Tank".

## The Success

> Jo was able to demonstrate quickly her skills in capturing our ‘organisational essence’, demonstrating a sound understanding of our corporate culture. Combined&nbsp; with her strong strategic skills and an experienced grasp of public sector dynamics, she enabled us to arrive at an informed view of what external landscape shifts can mean for us as a whole-organisation and to respond with greater confidence…..

## Testimonial

> MBO will be meeting these external sector 'shifts' with greater confidence and working with Jo has enabled us in that. John Diamond, CEO, Mulberry Bush
