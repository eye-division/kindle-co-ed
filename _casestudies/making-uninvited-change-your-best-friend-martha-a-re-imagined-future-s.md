  ***Change is the one constant we can absolutely rely on!*** But sometimes it
  feels uninvited, and is definitely at times, unexpected.


  ***Martha came to me for Coaching when a medical condition had forced the end
  of a career she loved.*** A musician, muscular-skeletal difficulties had put
  paid to a cherished life full of passion and fulfilment. Now ***it felt like
  she was in a life she didn't recognise***. She's lost her compass. ***In 6
  sessions***, she ***re-discovered her sense of purpose*** and re-imagined
  ***alternative futures***. **Here's how we did it....**&nbsp;

Change is the one constant we can absolutely rely on happening! But sometimes it feels uninvited and is definitely unexpected. Changes in ***health***, ***medical*** issues, accidents, ***bereavement***, family ***relationships***, ***jobs***...they can all fall prey to factors outside our control. Sometimes we find ourselves in a life we don't altogether recognise. That was ***Martha's story*** when she came to me for Coaching.&nbsp;

A talented musician, muscular-skeletal difficulties had put paid to a cherished way of life, full of passion and fulfilment. &nbsp;

Now, I can relate to this, as someone who had to swing career paths aged 22. Doesnâ€™t sound that old, does it? But this was after I had devoted many years of specialist (one might call it 'elite' level) training in the service of that one vocation, and was cut off in its prime due to a medical condition. With it went not just a livelihood but a whole social system and peer group - a whole way of being. I am an empath anyway, but I could really relate to this one!

What important at such junctures - and make no mistake, they are ***traumatic*** and ***life changing*** - is to have some mechanism for ***grieving the past***, ***accepting the present*** and ***re-imagining your future***. But doing this alone can be isolating, and at moments of vulnerability, prone to lack of concrete action.

Martha was determined not to sit back and only be a victim of circumstance. I was already struck by her willpower and 'can do' attitude when I met her. So I knew we would make a great&nbsp; ***Coach-&nbsp; Coachee match***. There is no criticism when I say I meet potential clients who don't exhibit those qualities - it absolutely goes with the territory of ***uninvited change*** coming into our lives. As I like to say, it can ***turn up***, ***sit in your favourite chair*** and ***walk off in your best shoes!***

&nbsp;So how was I able to help Martha ?

In **6&nbsp; sessions**, together we dialled back in to Marth's innate **skills & abilities**, those that her life in Music had honed, and worked on re-imagining those in new contexts.

By **session 3**, Martha could see new possibilities emerging, which she herself generated with my help and support, for how to ***redeploy her experience and talents***. Experience and authority, gained not only from her Musical life, but from her mastery of navigating complex social relationships of the sort one typically finds in musical groups and communities, and in family life. She was a great collaborator, natural organiser and, as our sessions discovered, had a flair for copy-writing.&nbsp;

More importantly, by **session 5**, we had deep-dived enough into what felt closest to her heart in terms of ***personal values***. Using ***my own structured approach***, to help unpeel the layers, which can ***'mask'*** who we truly are (and yes, we all do this to an extent!), Martha was able to construct a magnificent ***set of 'next steps'*** which truly ***aligned*** with her core values. Together, we had worked to tame the sorts of ***self-limiting beliefs*** we all fall prey to, into something much more manageable for her to ***move forward*** with.

Marth's 'will', which I referred to at the start of this little piece, didn't have to work in isolation however. I was there to provide an essential element of ***accountability*** \- so vital to effective Coaching. A ***buddy*** who can help keep you on track with progress - ***progress*** which does not have to change the world, but can and does come, one step at a time.

If you would like to empower yourself to ***turn change***, ***from your 'uninvited guest' into your best friend***, book your [free Discovery Call](/contact/) with me today.

Together, we can re-imagine your bright future.

See you soon,
