In a reflective piece, I seek to **explore some of the systems-level inequities** built in to the national resources, agency infrastructures and working practices surrounding **adults who support children classed as 'vulnerable'&nbsp;** and ask: where do parent-carers fit in ?

For anyone who enjoys a bit of a **gander through systems-change thinking**, read on. If not, I'd go make a cup of tea…..

When new statutory guidance emphasising the importance of Mental Health provision in supporting Looked After Children, was published by Government back in 2015, its arrival was marked by **an excellent event hosted by** [**NCB**](https://www.ncb.org.uk/). Contributors from **DfE** and **DoH** came together with nationally recognised figures in the field of Adoption, and from the 'big three' of&nbsp;**Health**, **Education** and **Social Care**.

However there was nothing on the formal Agenda,&nbsp; and little or no discussion amongst delegates at the tables, on the support that might be needed for the adults, working directly with these vulnerable children.

> **No-one tabled the question:** *how do adults process the emotional impact of their work, on themselves, and those around them?&nbsp;*
>
>
> **In a room full of Health professionals, this seemed strangely at odds** with the realities so many adults face, in the course of their daily support task.&nbsp;

For those forming a team around a child, either at work or at home, many adults fall entirely outside any concrete system of support for their role which is focused on their own wellbeing, mental and emotional health.

There is a distinct lack of support which is in any way&nbsp;**systematised, rooted in evidence-based practice and which &nbsp;recognises the needs of all the adults involved, equally.**&nbsp;

What does exist is not equitable in its access. Even where it is accessible (for example via a GP referral), these services are fundamentally **disconnected to the 'Team' environment**&nbsp;and it tends to throw up additional challenges around the table when stakeholders meet to discuss support and planning for (and with) a young person.

By way of example, &nbsp;**Social Workers** and **Clinicians** attending that day back in 2015, were able to cite some existing structures in the workplace, including '***Supervision***' (not the line management sort, the 'psychotherapy' sort, just to coin a phrase).

**Education professionals** were not able to cite examples at all - a supportive Line Manager was a close as it got.&nbsp;

**Foster Carers** were more likely to be viewed as Professionals. They could access training through Local Authority generated support.

**Adoptive Parents** felt almost on their own 'post-&nbsp; permanence'.&nbsp;

*Then there were* ***Parent-Carers….***

***This turned up a big fat zero, systemically-speaking.*&nbsp;**

There is no 'workplace' support scheme for parent-carers, despite many parents of vulnerable children finding themselves in the workplace (usually other people's) very frequently.

**Carers of young people with Health conditions for example or Disabilities typically have to pitch up to some sort of statutory agency setting, numerous times a year.** These encounters &nbsp;can be great: enriching, helpful and effective. But the experience of some parent-carers seems to be that these occasions, can sometimes be, the opposite of that.&nbsp;

Truth to be told, there were not many Parent - Carers at the 2015 event (not surprising when you consider it was in the working day, aimed very much at Agency representatives, and was about statutory guidance….) . It can all seem quite dull if you are not that way inclined\! &nbsp;It's important to say clearly here that **NCB,&nbsp;** as co-organisers of the erstwhile event, are an organisation most definitely banging the drum of support with and for parent-carers and if &nbsp;you're interested to know more, you view some of NCB's work with parent-carers&nbsp;**via the video link above**. No criticism implied of the 2015 gathering.

**It was (and is) perhaps however reflective, of this uneven national picture, that the emotional wellbeing of adults including parent-carers, in teams - around - the - child, was not on the Agenda.**

So what does happen in families who find themselves unwittingly **at the front line** ***of both child's emotional needs at home, and the services 'negotiating ground'?***

In the past decade, I have become acutely aware through my professional work and the community circles I move in, of the toll it takes those adults when delivering these support roles.

Many parent-carers (and professionals) given a suitably "safe space" &nbsp;would say, it's a massive challenge.&nbsp; Regardless of&nbsp; levels of self-efficacy or of eventual outcomes.

***There is a need for something that extends beyond informal cups of coffee as support.***.

For many parent-carers, they will say&nbsp;**there is a need to process the emotions that come up when they feel:**

* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)&nbsp;**de-skilled**\: carers are frequently trying out fresh strategies which they are given by professionals, or which they train themselves in, to support an aspect of their child's development
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)**disempowered**\: this can happen when professionals are discussing what they will, and won't, give a child. It should be of course according to assessment of need but, is increasingly, pegged to available resources&nbsp;
* ![](/uploads/kindle-templates-bullet-1.jpg)***empathy***&nbsp;**vs. frustration**&nbsp;- a mixed bag of emotion that seeps in during a conversation with a skilled, dedicated, but over-worked and possibly&nbsp;**under-resourced professional** whose just failed to implement a key part of a child's support plan

After multi-party meetings, professionals usually have some sort of peer group, line management or staff room to go back to from which to draw support - colleagues perhaps with whom to refresh strategy, for the next meeting. Parent -carers usually exit those encounters alone. However supportive their homelife is, home it is not always the best, or even appropriate receptacle, for dumping&nbsp; 'agency overspill' into, 10 times a year.

Then there are our **Public Sector leaders**. They too must take very difficult decisions about **service reform & transformation**. That surely comes with an emotional cost, especially in an era of heavily - reduced budgets. No-one goes into **Corporate Parenting**&nbsp;because they enjoy saying 'no' to families…

**What about Local Authority Early Help&nbsp;**offers for Families?

These are ostensibly provided to support families with a child with complex health or Disability. But to me they seem extremely variable. **Parent-carers can find these very off -putting** because the entire process sits in a **Safeguarding** frame. Engagement is frequently led by professionals used to driving any 'assessment' of Help, **through the lens of Child Protection**.&nbsp; Google a few randomly selected examples on 'Early Help' -&nbsp; you will find some Local Authorities are much more welcoming in their tone, than others.

**So, I have begun****&nbsp;*a journey of 'curious enquiry'*&nbsp;.&nbsp;**I am fortunate to have a relationship with a range of organisations, stakeholder groups and dedicated individuals (including parents) who experience the highs and lows of supporting vulnerable children. &nbsp;

A sort of **3 - way lens** has been slowly but surely building, of **professional, &nbsp;stakeholder&nbsp; and personal story perspectives.&nbsp;**

It's multi-faceted**&nbsp;kaleidoscope view&nbsp;**and **&nbsp;**I'm committed to deploying it for the **greater good**.

**There is a debate to be had nationally**&nbsp;a**bout how to resource and systematise equally, the maintaining of wellbeing for all adults in a team** **around a child.&nbsp;**

Experts might refer to the need to raise awareness of psycho-dynamic theory and the benefits of&nbsp;**Reflective practice.** **Many parents would simply call it the need for 'team skills'**&nbsp;.&nbsp;

I think at sector-level, it is even more basic: its the the need for systems which actively promote **equal value**&nbsp;of all participants around the support table.

**A national offer is therefore needed which is equitable in its access and includes Parent and Teachers wellbeing, alongside Clinicians and Social Workers**.

It should not be workplace or seniority -specific and needs to be able to sit&nbsp;**outside of Child Protection.**&nbsp;Something that supports all Team members around a child - regardless of their formal 'job' title.

I am in dialogue with a range of professionals in Health, Education, Therapeutic services as well as with Parent-Carers, in building awareness of this issue.&nbsp;

***If you*** ***would like to talk to me about 'supporting the supporters'** of vulnerable children and young people, do get in touch.*

**I'm all ears.**
