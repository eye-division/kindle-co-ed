## The People

A specialist tour operator for musical children & young people in the travel industry.

## The Challenge

To create opportunities for the client to expand their core business outside the UK, raise their profile as a company and simultaneously benefit young people, as a first step into social responsibility work.

## Our Response

Kindle provided research & development to identify opportunities for new markets and brokered dialogue with new clients on their behalf. We developed a project template for the client to use when considering new projects in the future, enabling them to make informed decisions independently about the benefits of projects with both business and social objectives.

## The Success

Kindle has introduced the client to a pool of new partners and potential clients that will allow extension of its core business. This will be achieved through partnership working with the not for profit and public sector and result in giving new opportunities to young people from different locations to work together.
