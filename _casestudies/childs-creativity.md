KindleCo successfully **bid to design and deliver** the **organisational modelling** and&nbsp; **sector-level stakeholder consultation**, to shape the future of the DfE / DCMS national Creative Partnerships initiative in the South East.

The contract's purpose was to **provide an exit strategy for the end of this centrally-run Government programme** both for the sponsoring agency, Arts Council South East, and the multitude of **strategic and operations partners** engaged in the Programme since inception.

This was to help&nbsp;**ensure a legacy for the investment for Government** and for the programme's **end -beneficiaries of Teachers, Artists and Children & Young People themselves**. It was also to **provide a route map for the exit** and beyond as a **transition bridge** to the future, **establish tolerances in the potential business model** and help **scope future partners and purpose**. In short to **provide a structure on which to hang next steps**, thus providing **momentum for all stakeholders** and safeguarding a **return on investment of public funds**.

**KindleCo worked extensively across the region to bring the education, learning, culture, business and economic development communities together in an integrated approach** to support the creative learning infrastructure for children & young people in schools. With multiple stakeholders, KindleCo worked with the national programmes four regional leaders to generated models of how best to grow Creative Partnerships beyond its original constituencies.
