    <h2>Working Together<strong> </strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>What work could we do together as an organisation ? &nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p>deepen an understanding of your <em><strong>external environment</strong></em>, navigate and shape it</p>
    <p>contextualise your <em><strong>upcoming work streams</strong></em> and projects to align with external sector factors, to help make them more <em><strong>sustainable</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>identify <strong>meaningful alliances </strong>of practical operational value, built around your purpose, including <em><strong>stakeholder engagement </strong></em>and strategic partnerships&nbsp;</p>
    <p>deploy <strong>external change as a driver</strong> for your own project or <em><strong>OD</strong></em></p>
    <h3><strong>What could the outcomes be?</strong></h3>
    <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my consultancy is bespoke but in all I do&nbsp;<strong>I strive to build:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Knowledge</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Confidence</strong>,<strong> Capacity </strong>&amp;<strong> Capability</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p>A rounded <strong>360 view of resource development: </strong>this is a "must" in today's fiscal climate,&nbsp; so expect our discussions to include developing objectives around strategic <strong>partnerships</strong>, sector&nbsp;<strong>positioning</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong>, as well as <strong>funding</strong></p>

    <h3><strong>What work could we do together as an individual? &nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;work through together your current and upcoming challenges, be those to your own career, wellbeing, social health or support in <em><strong>advocating </strong></em>for your child</p>
    <p><strong>What I don't do: </strong>I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you and your business partners to help align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership or project strategy</p>

  <h3><strong>Children's Voices, Mental Health and the national conversation</strong></h3>
  <p class="callout center-this-text"><strong>I published my very first <em>LinkedIn </em>article to mark #WMHD</strong></p>
  <p class="center-this-text"><strong></strong>My great thanks to all those who read, liked, shared and gave me such valuable feedback, including on <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="https://twitter.com/jobroad_kin">@jobroad_kin</a>&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/contact/"><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>
  <p><strong>MH was, and is still, riding high in the media like never before.</strong> Campaigns to end stigma, raise awareness and promote resilience abound. Children &amp; YP&rsquo;s Mental Health is front of stage. These are all positives.</p>
  <p><strong>But how, why and when do the attitudes to Mental Health, that our children later go on to adopt, really begin?</strong> And do the campaign headlines mean the tide of &lsquo;stigma&rsquo; is turning?</p>

  <p class="callout center-this-text"><em>My article received some encouraging responses - thank-you!</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>&ldquo;Brilliant blog.</strong></em>.I wholeheartedly agree that we need to address stereotypes of mental health and disabilities from a young age. We need to listen to enable children to have a voice and engage them in dialogues about mental wellbeing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><em><strong>&ldquo;A great article with clear insights </strong></em>into our children and mental health&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
