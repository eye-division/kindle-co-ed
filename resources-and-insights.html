  <h3><strong>What makes working with me, Jo Broad, different from other, less specialised Consultancies?</strong></h3>
  <div>
    <p class="callout">
      <font color="#7271a0"></font>
    </p>
    <font color="#7271a0"><b>I am expert in supporting individuals &amp; organisations</b></font>
    <p><strong>working with a backdrop of public policy &amp; government systems around children, young people &amp; families.</strong> </p>

  <div>
    <p>&nbsp;Through my 30 years in the sector, I have successfully navigated landscapes of continual change. This means I don't just 'talk the talk' on adjusting to sector change, but have 'walked the walk' too, at the front line! Through my Organisational Consultancy, I have helped 100s of professionals to do the same.</p>
  </div>
  <h4><em>I strive to 'walk in your shoes'.&nbsp;</em></h4>

  <h3><strong>What work could we do together as an organisation ? &nbsp;</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>As a Consultant,&nbsp; I can help you identify&nbsp;opportunities </strong>arising from change including:&nbsp;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#7271a0"><b>Scenario-plan &amp; align&nbsp;</b></font>
  </p>upcoming work streams, projects or development plans with external sector landscape, both current &amp; anticipated, in times of flux <p><strong>Relationship building&nbsp;</strong>focussing attention on shared purpose, including with your&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Strategic shaping &amp; planning </strong>sensitive to both staying true to your mission &amp; values, whilst working with the opportunities afforded by sector change, rather than swimming against it&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>What could the likely outcomes be ?</strong></h4>
  <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my Consultancy &amp; Coaching is tailored but in our work together you can expect to grow your and your staff's&nbsp;<strong>Knowledge</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Confidence</strong>,<strong> Capabilities, Self-Determination in the face of sector change</strong></p>
  <div><em><strong>What I don't do</strong></em></div>
  <div><em><strong>For organisations:&nbsp;</strong>I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you and your business partners to help align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership or project strategy.</em>
