  <h3><strong>Children's Voices, Mental Health and the national conversation</strong></h3>
  <p>To mark WMHD 2017, <strong>I published my very first <em>LinkedIn </em>article</strong>. My great thanks to all those who read, liked, shared and gave me such valuable feedback, including on <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="https://twitter.com/jobroad_kin">@jobroad_kin</a>&nbsp;<a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/contact/"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>:</p>
  <p>MH is riding high in the media like never before. Campaigns to end stigma, raise awareness and promote resilience abound. Children &amp; YP&rsquo;s Mental Health is front of stage. These are all positives.</p>
  <p>But how, why and when do the attitudes to Mental Health, that our children later go on to adopt, really begin? And do the campaign headlines mean the tide of &lsquo;stigma&rsquo; is turning?</p>
  <p>Read the full article <a data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="/casestudies/">here</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em><strong>Some great responses</strong></em></p>
  <p><em><strong>&ldquo;Brilliant blog.</strong></em>.I wholeheartedly agree that we need to address stereotypes of mental health and disabilities from a young age. We need to listen to enable children to have a voice and engage them in dialogues about mental wellbeing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><em><strong>&ldquo;A great article with clear insights </strong></em>into our children and mental health&rdquo; @jobroad_kin</p>
