    <h3><strong>What makes working with me, Jo Broad, unique?</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <font color="#7271a0"><b>I am expert in supporting individuals &amp; organisations</b></font>&nbsp;working with a backdrop of public policy &amp; government systems around children, young people &amp; families. So, at work, I have navigated landscapes of continual change. I have personal experience, too,&nbsp; of forced- change and career endings due to external circumstances. This means I don't just 'talk the talk' on adjusting to personal &amp; professional change, but have 'walked the walk' too!
    </div>
    <div> </div>
    <h4><em>This all enables me to 'walk in your shoes'.&nbsp;</em></h4>
    <div> </div>
    <h4><strong></strong><strong>What work could we do together 1:1 through Coaching ?</strong></h4>
    <div>Compassionately examine your current challenges in life, at home or at work, and <em><strong>the role 'change' is playing in these</strong></em>. We will dial back in to your sense of purpose, innate talents &amp; abilities to enable you to generate a structured plan for next steps and lead yourself confidently into new horizons.</div>
    <div> </div>
    <h3><strong>What work could we do together as an organisation ? &nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p><strong><strong>As a Consultant,&nbsp; I can help you identify&nbsp;</strong>opportunities </strong>arising from change&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
    <p>
      <font color="#7271a0"><b>Scenario-plan &amp; align&nbsp;</b></font>upcoming work streams, projects or development plans with external sector landscape, both current &amp; anticipated, in times of flux
    </p>
    <p><strong>Relationship build:&nbsp;</strong>re-focus attention on shared purpose, including with&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <p><strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3><strong>What work could we do together through Mentoring ?</strong></h3>
    <div>Support project teams as times of change, to stay aligned with values and mission.</div>
    <div>Support individuals, as they navigate change due to external factors and circumstances, to draw on their skills &amp; talents and find work-arounds to prevent obstacles becoming a dead-end.</div>
    <div> </div>
    <h4><strong>What would the outcomes be ?</strong></h4>
    <p>Every piece of work &amp; every community is different. All my Consultancy &amp; Coaching is tailored but in our work together you can expect to grow your&nbsp;<strong>Knowledge</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Confidence</strong>,<strong> </strong><strong>Capabilities, Self-Determination</strong></p>
    <div><em><strong>What I don't do</strong></em></div>
    <div><em><strong>For organisations:&nbsp;</strong>I am not a communications, PR or marketing agency. But I will work with you and your business partners to help align these functions, within your overall organisational, partnership or project strategy.&nbsp;<strong></strong></em></div>
    <div><em><em><strong>For individuals:&nbsp;</strong>I am not a medical professional, therapist or councellor. But I will use my expert knowledge &amp; expereince to Coach or Mentor you through a period of change,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>at work or at home, so that you can move on to your next steps with a greater sense of confidence and self-determination.</em></em></div>
